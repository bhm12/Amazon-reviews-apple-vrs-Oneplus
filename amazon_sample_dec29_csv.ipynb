I am used to Samsung, Galaxies, LQ and even other cheaper phones out there. This is my first I phone. I find it totally dumb. While understand no phone is perfect and all have certain pros and cons; for the life of me I cannot understand that the Iphone is something that people like and are willing to pay good money for it. I understand that the camera and optic characteristics of this phone are something people like. For my part, I use my phone mainly as a phone or texting device. And these are the areas where I find the phone is lacking. To name a couple. When a call enters, I do not have an option (or not always) of rejecting the call or answer with a message, there is only one option: answer. After a call from a new number, in other phones, if I touch the number it will give an opportunity to convert into a contact, call the person or text. With the iphone, if you touch the number it will call the person back. I went into the movies yesterday and, as it is customary by civilized people, I muted the bloody phone in question. But the phone decided to ring loud when a call entered. Another thing that bugs the hell out of me is that the phone decides that, since I am driving, \"it will not disturb me and let any calls enter...\" I thought I had bought a phone, not a parent. Before you buy any phone from this company make sure you give it a good test and make sure that the actions that you take for granted in your other phones will be included with this new phone and good luck', \"The iPhone 7 is a serious step backward by Apple.  Prior to this, my biggest complaint was the battery life.  However, I could have the phone plugged in charging, while listening to music on my headset or talking on the phone.  With only 1 plug now, instead of 2, you can either charge your phone OR use your headset, but not both.  Further my old headsets do not fit the 7, and the 7 headset won't fit my iMac.  I bought two splitters and adapters and the splitters did not work, and the adapter is hard to keep up with.Second, the touch screen is insensitive and about 1/3 of my touches are not detected.  There is a heavy and a light touch but when holding the phone with one hand and / or typing quickly, you cannot control the different touch levels.In the past, when you bought an Apple product, you got a solid operating system that had been thoroughly tested and you did not have to update all the time.  Not anymore; you can spend as much time updating your phone and apps as you spend using it now.Many of the new features are a nuisance unless you are a teenager, and you cannot turn them off, and they constantly try to cram the Apple Subscription Music service down your throat. I want to turn that feature off, and not be asked about it another hundred times.I loved my old iPhone 5 despite the short battery life.  Given the computing power of the phone, I could understand that, and had back up battery packs I could use.  But I hate my iPhone 7 and would highly recommend against buying one.\", \"I upgraded to the iPhone 7 and have to say that most of my experience has been good. The larger size was a change but after a few weeks I really like that. The one main complaint is the removal of the headphone jack. My home stereo system has a connection, but is not blue tooth enabled, which means I either no longer listen to my music on my home entertainment system, or I now have to buy a new stereo, plus now my earphones are basically worthless. Plus my truck isn't enabled either, so now I just listen on the phone. The jury is still out as to whether I'm going to downgrade, as the other features are nice, if not for the headphone jack change it would have been a 5 star. If you only have blue tooth devices to connect to, go ahead and upgrade.\", 'This phone is a ticking time bomb! 11 days after the warrant expired the phone went into a rebooting loop. After spending hours on end with the apple support tech they asked me to go to the nearest apple store. I waited 3 hours for them to plug my phone in and tell me they are going to have to ship the phone off. The stated that I could get an express replacement for over $300. Terrible customer service and the company is loosing touch with quality and customer care! Never buy this product', \"The iPhone 7, a giant leap in cellphone technology? Not quite.This phone IS advanced but fragile. AppleCare and insurance is a necessity.Removing the headphone jack seems to have caused some major problems. It is a fragile little flower of a cell phone. Yes it might be waterproof, but that doesn't help if it does not work.I have been loyal apple user for years and yet within 30 days I am awaiting my second replacement iPhone 7 - on the first phone the charging port (and headphone port now) failed and actually pushed the cable out (ghost in the machine?). That was in the first week - it was replaced and the Second phone lasted 14 days before the same port failed completely. No headphones. No charging. No backing up!! Big bummer!!It's not Steve Job's apple anymore but I can't see another device that appeals!!!\", 'I\\'ve had Apple iPhone\\'s for years, and I only own Apple computers and iPads, but I hate this iPhone7 so much I think I\\'ll try turning it back in and getting an iPhone 6.  This is my problem: I teach fitness classes at a dozen different gyms all with different sound systems, and because the iPhone doesn\\'t have a headphone jack, I can no longer connect to their sound system.  Yes, the iPhone came with an adapter, but that 2 inch adapter was quickly lost with all the running around that I do.  SO, I bought a dozen inexpensive adapters from China to have plenty of extras on hand (about $1 each as opposed to the Apple price of $9) but when I plug them in, they work for about 10 seconds, then they stop working with a message on my iPhone that says something like, \"This accessory is not supported.\"  This whole situation has become an expensive, inconvenient mess for me.  It seems that with the new iPhone, I cannot easily charge and listen to my headphones at the same time, and that if I lose my headphone adapter I\\'m forced to buy the expensive iPhone brands.  Someone told me that they got rid of the headphone jacks so that people would be forced to by the blue tooth ear buds.  Apple!  This is a disaster for me, and it really does appear that you engineered this inconvenience just to sell more accessories.  How about thinking about what would be most convenient for your customers, who are paying $800 for an iPhone?', \"Grrrrr! I hate so much about this new phone!!I hate that they did away with the head phone jack! It's so annoying. I'm not getting my voicemails, and it's the glitchyest iPhone yet. I've been an iPhone lover for more than 7 years! And now I'm thinking about the pixel 😠Booo Apple boo!\", \"I bought this mistake in August after hearing all the hype about the need to have an I phone.  Big mistake.  I am now stuck with an over priced piece of crap tha for the next two year.  I would have less issues if this phone for the money included high quality material .three weeks after I bought it it slipped off the coffee table 18 inches high A ND THE SCREEN CRACKED!  I then found out their was only one Apple Store in Tucson.  Once I finally got there they want to charge 129 dollars for replacement glass.  After s few heated words turn out they realized I had insurance -- so only 29 dollars please and even though I had an appointment there would be several hours of wait time.  By the way we have fine selection an Apple labeled junk for you to look at and max your credit card out on while you wait.  I asked if they would please install the screen cover I had brought with me..  They said yes, then several hours later when I got back my repaired apple I was asked to wait another 20 minutes, then approached and told Apple does not install third party equipment, but they could sell me a protector and install it - for 39 dollars.  I left in disgust.So far the list of apps recommended for Apple aren't available,  I can't import my music, and there's no such thing as an working app.  Siri sucks.  My bar strength has gone from four bars to two if I'm Lucky. Bleck!!!  Buy and Android!\", \"Apple needs to get rid of that gray toolbar aka dock aka crap on the bottom of screen.

Each phone's ringtone and any clicking sound stop working after about 2 years of use. No damage caused by me at all. When I called Apple they said it's out of warranty and it would cost about $300 to replace or repair the phone. This happened for both iphone. I read the book Steve Jobs and I realized Apple's strategy is to integrate everything and hard to repair them. I think they don't care about customer's burden for repair.

I saw a lot of reviews were people received locked phones, phones that were not exactly what were described, and phones that were damaged.  Also people had received phones that did not work up to par. However, these reviews were only a small margin of the overall reviews. I bit the bullet thinking maybe I could just return it if it wasn't what I wanted. It came in original Apple packaging, was unlocked and worked with my Sim card immediately, and is exactly what I was looking for. I'm beyond pleased with this phone so far. I've only had it for under a week at this point.  Chances are I will update this review in a few months as to whether or not my satisfaction changes.

I guess that could be because of the apps getting downloaded and account sync during the setup.I will update the comment after using the phone for a while with the performance and battery life.Giving four stars because of the packaging.Update,1) The Battery issue is not there anymore.2) The heating issue is still there. However, I think that is because of my extensive use. Nothing of an iPhone/seller related problem.3) The touch, however, is not that good.

I have never had an apple product that did not work right out of the box, but maybe that's because all others have come directly from Apple. I tried charging and it still would not turn on. But after speaking with tech support, they suggested I try another of my charging cables and that finally did the trick. So they gave me a credit to buy another cable and now I'm a very happy camper. Great little phone for those of us who don't feel the need to be continually upgrading.

I don't use my phone for everything.  I have a small iPad and MacBook that I use for browsing, reading etc.  The SE is a perfect sized phone for me since it is carried in my pocket.  The others are just too big.Second, you are getting a NEW IPHONE for $250.  In the era of $1000 phones that is remarkable.  It has an A9 chip and 32GB of memory, so plenty of horsepower for a user like me.  For a real power user, the smaller screen would be a definite handicap.These are Apple shrink wrapped new but with a caveat. The warranty is already ticking.  Mine had 8 months left.  There is a Apple warranty site where you can look your device up.  Unfortunately you have to remove the shrink wrap to see the required serial number.I was able to negotiate a small discount because of this but be aware, you are getting a new phone that is not under the normal 1 year warranty.  Apple still covers it but not for the full year.  Obviously, your experience will vary depending on your reseller.  The warranty starts ticking when the reseller buys them from Apple, I was told.\", \"I love my new phone!! It is so cute, it is a perfect size phone for me  -- I've had 6 inches phones before and I'm learning to realize how uncomfortable they felt carrying around and holding in my hand until I bought this smaller size phone. It looks and performs like a brand new iPhone and it comes with a three month guarantee. I absolutely recommend buying a tempered glass screen protector as soon as you buy this phone, and a phone case, because iPhones are incredibly fragile compared to other brands. The seller was very nice and communicated with me about my purchase. I love this phone to pieces and recommend it to people who like comfortable, cute, fast performing and stylish smart phones.\", 'I was intrigued with a small screen smartphone and noticed that Apple was phasing this out so I jumped to get one.

I tried another type of phone after that but now I've returned to iPhone. I'm happy to have a good phone that works and that will last. The SE isn't the newest but it's not old yet.

A used unlocked iPhone SE 64 gbs for only $250!!!  Great condition.  I couldn't be more pleased!!!\", 'I tried on two separate occasions to buy an SE fulfilled by amazon. In both cases phone was clearly not NEW per Amazon’s condition policy. Phones were clearly reshrinked wrapped by hand. My suspicion is store demo units.Things to look for to show not really new.- Apple shrink wrap is perfect (seams should be perfectly straights and so thin, almost not viewable)- No sticker over the barcode- USB cable should be coiled perfectly if done by Apple factory. Each loop of the cable will perfectly line up with previous loop. Hand cooled cables are never done right.- Any marks on device period. New Apple products should never have any finger prints, dust under the screen protector or dirt/marks of any kind.Check the manufacture date via the warranty check. If it shows 1978 then it is a store demo unit.Sadly shady sellers are trying to pass these phones off as new, hence the substantial cost savings.', \"I’m pretty sure this was a refurbished phone. It does not work very well. So I’m updating from the previous review.I *downgraded from the iPhone 6S Plus, which was great for remote video conference calls for a job, but I no longer have that need. The larger phone never worked too too well, and when I had to change the screen, it was downhill from there when the home button finally called it quits. It was just too big and wasn't really great for ease of use with one hand. It was like a small tablet. Relieved to be done with it. The SE is perfect size and contains the functionality and features of a 6, so far from what I can tell.The iPhone SE unlocked, 64 gig, rose gold, is the one I purchased. It did NOT come with the most recent iOS 11... installed. It had an iOS 9... installed. Also, I believe it might have bean originally intended for the Russian or Bangladesh market because some of the set up options were defaulted to those countries. It's no matter. I updated the iOS, and set my settings to USA and EST, and am good to go.Also to note relatedly, If you use AirPods, you'll need the current iOS for them to connect. They would not connect with the older iOS. Don't forget to *forget the airpods from an older iPhone, again, if you're using them.I installed my SIM card for AT&T from my 6S+ and there was NO issue on that front. It was fully compatible. The phone is picking up Wi-Fi signals and runs smoothly.This is a good product. So far I am pleased. And since the cell carriers no longer offer discounts, the price at $379 was in budget. No contract. Unlocked. May the best carrier win.\", 'I thought I was purchasing an unlocked iphone.  This phone was actually LOCKED by Sprint with an outstanding payment due.  After HOURS trying to figure out the problem I am returning the phone.  Beware!', 'This Iphone is NOT unlocked. False advertising.

The American model is A1662 and is compatible with the big 3 according to the apple website.  I asked the seller if they would send me an A1662 to replace the A1723, but they didn't give a straight answer.  I got a t-mobile compatible sim card and so far it works well.

At this point, the screen freezes/doesn't respond, it goes to sleep so quickly I can't see messages/doesn't go to sleep on its own; these issues are happening multiple times each day.  I have been very careful with this (since I haven't put the screen protector on yet) so these issues aren't related to any accidents since I've had it.  I'm so frustrated and disappointed!

I received my package today and was very satisfied until I looked at the back of the box and noticed something strange. The instructions were in Spanish first, then English. I thought this was odd as it's usually the other way around. I got in touch with Apple and gave them the serial number of the phone and they let me know that it's from Latin America and not meant to be sold in the United States. This means that there is no valid warranty on the (brand new) phone and I am unable to purchase AppleCare or take it to the Apple store to get it repaired. This also means I will possibly have trouble putting it on my Verizon plan and using it. Needless to say, I am very upset as I purchased this phone as Christmas gift. Now it's two days before Christmas and I have a phone that shouldn't have even been sold in this country. I am very disappointed in the carelessness of the seller who didn't bother to include this detail in the product description.

The first thing to go was the screen lock button. It has worked on and off since the purchase. Now the speaker is starting to fail. At first it would cause a loud crackling sound when recording videos, which isn’t too bad because I don’t take many vids. But now it’s getting to the point where people I talk to on the phone can sometimes not hear me. It’s bad when a “new” phone can’t be used for its most basic function, a phone call.

After 1 day of use (after I switched my AT&T SIM card from my old phone and put it in this one, it stopped recognizing the carrier. It only connected to wifi, and I couldn\\'t receive or make any calls. AT&T told me that when they looked up the IMEI number of this new phone, it was still registered as INVENTORY AT BEST BUY. They said that a phone will work for a day or so before AT&T recognizes it as a device belonging to a store (in this case, Best Buy), and they automatically put a \"device restriction\" on the phone so that it is not usable. While AT&T assured me I hadn\\'t bought a stolen phone, I didn\\'t understand how it could have been a legit purchase from the Amazon seller, Electronic Deals. AT&T told me there was nothing they could do, and that I needed to contact Best Buy to get a receipt, showing Electronic Deals had bought the phone. That got me nowhere, so after 5 HOURS of digging around, making calls, and live chatting with different companies/people, I went a mile down the road and bought a new prepaid AT&T iPhone SE for $150. Took it to the AT&T store, and they switched over the SIM cards and now I have a legit, brand new, working phone. I\\'m not saying that Electronic Deals acquired this phone illegally, but it certainly did not arrive as stated: Prepaid, AT&T. Electronic Deals doesn\\'t handle customer service on weekends, so I have not been able to contact them. Thankfully, because they are a \"Fulfilled by Amazon\" seller, Amazon handles the return. I will drop off this item for return, and I should be getting a full refund within 7 days of the phone arriving back at Amazon.Original Review:Do your research on the SELLER before making any electronic purchase. The reviews for this specific phone are mixed because there are multiple sellers who have this item for sale. The iPhone SE retails for $350, and I bought this brand new for $203. I’m an existing AT&T customer, so I took the SIM card out of my old phone and popped it the new one- took all of 10 minutes to restore from an earlier backup, and it’s up and running! Definitely a great deal. Super happy with this heck of a deal!', \"I disliked this phone because no matter how long we had it charging, it would not charge. It wouldn't even power on.

Going to the AT&T website and checking the IMEI number before inserting your sim card will make no difference. this phone showed up as OK when in fact, it is not.if you are willing to take time to go through all those hoops and hope that AT&T will be okay to activate, then the price here (vs 350$ on Apple) is worth it.Just be aware.', 'Just to make a long story short.

But I knew it would have to be an iPhone, and my wife, moreover, insisted I accompany her to the Apple Store for my birthday gift--any Apple phone I chose.I went in with every intention to to get an iPhone 6S, since the lack of a headphone jack strikes me as impractical if not preposterous.  After auditioning 5-6 models, I left the store with the iPhone 7 Plus. The decision was simple--based primarily on one single criterion: the quality of the SOUND of MUSiC played back from the onboard speakers.The sales clerk suggested I not dismiss the 7 too quickly on the basis of the headphone jack omission.  First, the phone comes with an adapter that can be placed over your headphone pin and plugged into the charging port (that helps, especially given the collection of headphones I\\'ve acquired).  More importantly, the iPhone 7 is the first Apple phone with: 1. stereo (2) speakers; 2. pretty good (for a phone) speakers.The clerk then fired up a busy superhero movie score on the 4-5 iPhones I was considering.  Not helpful.  The clerk suggested pulling up any tune I wished through the store\\'s Apple Music Subscription.  I went with Miles Davis\\' \"Kind of Blue,\" which begins with Bill Evans rubato piano, then goes into tempo with Paul Chambers\\' acoustic bass (on \"So What\") in a call-response exchange between bass and ensemble.Using the iPhone 6s, with a single speaker, the bass was all but absent (the store was quite noisy).  Moving to the iPhone7 Plus, Chambers\\' bass walked right out of the phone speakers and into my ear, each pitch identifiable along with string \"buzz\" and extra-musical \"fingering\" noise.  Suddenly the question of the headphone jack was rendered meaningless.  The combination of stereo sound plus slightly more powerful, larger speakers was all I would need to get maximum value from the phone.I\\'m a hobbyist musician (piano), and I no longer practice with a notated score. All I require is a player (and a piano) to learn a tune, and a device like the iPhone 7 Plus makes learning new tunes easier than ever.I\\'m also a photographer of sorts, and the wider lens for unprecedented clarity shooting with available light as well as a feature permitting razor-sharp focus on a subject in the foreground and blurred-out focus on figures in the immediate background struck me as more than a novelty.  With my 35mm film cameras (Pentax Spotmatics), I\\'d have to switch to an expensive, long and heavy zoom lens to achieve the same effect.I\\'ve read that Apple may be planning on a blockbuster iPhone 8 with an OLED (curved) screen.  I think I can leave the curves to Marilyn Monroe or a Cinerama production..  The 7Plus should last me and, though it\\'s a tad big and cumbersome as a phone, it should be harder to misplace and/or lose than the previous half a dozen \"candy-bar phones\" were.  (I don\\'t need more than 1GB for using the phone, but 128GB is enough to carry a generous supply of music tracks and space for making videos).Only problems: finding the best carrier for the least money and unloading three barely used cell phones (2 Jitterbugs and a Spark Aquos Crystal--good screen but artificially \"enhanced\" sound and barely accessible controls, if you can find them).', 'I’ve been an iPhone user for years now and I’ve had the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and the iPhone 6s. Currently, I am a user of the iPhone 7 plus. Now that I own an iPhone 7 plus and have adjusted to using it, I can speak on both the advantages and disadvantages that come with the phone. For instance, Apple decided to add a double camera which I think is a good enhancement because it helps to improve the quality of the pictures that I take. I often take pictures of myself, my friends and events that I am a part of. A good quality picture can help to preserve good memories. For example, taking pictures at Thanksgiving and Christmas with all the family around the table and the children playing. Looking back at the pictures from these events makes you feel like you’re back in that very moment you took the picture. One of the features Apple decided to remove was having a jack for the headphones. Instead they replaced the headphone jack with another speaker. That is a upside to not having a plug for the headphones now, because now the phone is louder. However, I can not listen to music in my headphones and charge my phone at the same time which can sometimes be an inconvenience. In comparison to the iPhone 6s, the iPhone 7 has better and more advanced features. If you are a person who is constantly using their phone and likes to have all the newest techno devices, I would recommend this phone 100%. Overall I believe that the phone has made many well thought out decisions, regardless of the sacrifices that had to be made.', 'Hello!

Today I have just received it and boom... The first thing it says is \"this phone must be activated on SIMPLE Mobile Service\" I\\'m not in the US. I\\'m in the Dominican Republic. This is a scam. It\\'s not an unblocked clean IPhone.', \"No iPhone 7 plus black I got a piece of junk don't buy from this sellers\", '...Don\\'t believe the hype. Where do I begin? First the good. The speakers are fantastic - stereo, bass, volume, clarity. Two bottom firing speakers and one coming from the earpiece. The best speakers I\\'ve heard on any mobile device.Now the bad and the ugly. Scrolling, believe it or not. A simple flick barely moves a web page any distance. It\\'s almost like friction slows it down. The keyboard, whilst great at prediction, is an absolute nightmare for numbers & punctuation. It easily ruins my flow. Third up is lack of confirmation when sending. Send an email and hope for the best. No \"message sent\" and sometimes it wasn\\'t sent. Fourth, rearranging & sorting images. Ya can\\'t. Folder management... isn\\'t. Trying to save media from Safari? Well that\\'s hit or miss. If you don\\'t press the exact amount of pressure you might just get up pop-up option to save that you must use a second finger to save or you might get a sustaining link or the picture might just pop out.Now onto music. All of my music is on memory card and Google Drive. In other words, Sayonara. Either that or I must upload my 3000 songs to iTunes. Wanna send music to your friend via email or WhatsApp? Impossible. Wanna extract music sent to you? Pull out your laptop and get iTunes.Where\\'s the intuitive part? More like a walled garden.Touch ID. I\\'m coming from Huawei Ascend Mate 7. With one touch I awaken and unlock my device. With iPhone 7, you must press twice with differing degrees of pressure but be careful. If you press too quickly, that pop up message will disappear & you\\'ll have to hunt for the message. That\\'s because the pull down notifications aren\\'t very informative.*****The worst part is that I must enter my card for Apple Pay as well as ID. As I\\'m returning my phone, I deleted my card from one of them. Guess what, Apple literally won\\'t allow me to delete my bank card from the other.****Which brings me to the App Store. Some iPhone apps are more polished. Most have no ads so expect to pay for them. How much? Anybody\\'s guess. Takes four clicks - get, install, buy, Touch ID. Far more convoluted than Android. Here\\'s the best part, no price is listed. So I bought these apps & I\\'m never told how much I\\'m charged. I can\\'t remove my bank info & my bank balance hasn\\'t changed.If Apple users think this is intuitive, it\\'s simply because they\\'ve never used any other device.On Android I can extract vids images and music from any browsers or messages. I can use apps to download free stuff. I can use browsers that allow me to name a file as I save it and save it where I choose. If I want to send someone a song, I can. With iPhone, I feel like a child on lock down.Let\\'s not get into the limited storage and lack of headset jack. I use Bluetooth too but when my battery is low, that\\'s a problem & I refuse to carry a dongle.Compared to Android flagships, it just looks cheap. Visible plastic antenna, a protruding camera that that makes the phone rock when flat, and those bezels - big forehead, big chin, love handles. Looks very datedIn many ways it just feels like a beginner\\'s phone. A quality device to post you meals on instagram, browse  Facebook and post on twitter. Takes a very good photo as well.As it comes very well set up to sync with other Apple devices and it doesn\\'t allow for outside music, if you\\'re already invested in Apple\\'s ecosystem you\\'ll probably like 7 just fine. If not, you\\'ll no longer have access to much of your stuff w/o a major headache.So when you hear that iPhones are more intuitive and just work, that\\'s simply not true. Clearly high end Androids have caught up and in many ways surpass iPhone just as they have in build quality. Saving media, Touch ID, commandeering bank info, keyboard, flexibility and especially compatibility are just horrible compared to my Huawei flagship. I can\\'t even reorder apps so I\\'m constantly flipping between screens.It\\'s a well made but very basic phone with limited compatibility. iPhone users will be at home because it\\'s the same app tray Apple has been serving up for years, with same dated icons. If you\\'re accustomed to high end Androids and actually utilize what they have to offer, you\\'ll feel as if you\\'ve downgraded.This iPhone is a very basic device & it is no more intuitive than modern day Android flagships.', \"The phone its self is great, but it has some improvement that need to be made such as the dongle they give you to use 3.5mm jack headphones constantly makes buzzing sounds. The phone also has some weird little bugs in the software such as one time I couldn't adjust the brightness so I had to power the phone off and then on and then it was fixed, another time the phone was stuck in landscape view and I had to power cycle it to get back to portrait view.\", \"I've had to go spend money on lightning charge adapters and wireless earphones.

The GoodThe photo cameras are excellent, the receiving sound quality of a call is equally good. The storage facility (256 GB) is awesome.... I do quite a bit of video at conferences and this is a very useful storage facility. Battery life is more or less the same as the previous models.  the quality of the glass is very good. The size of the phone is just right.2. The BadI do not know whether I have a factory \"FAULTY\" phone, but whenever I talk to people over the phone, despite their voice coming through loud and clear, my voice seems to be unclear.... I have just put completed a call to a friend and he complaint that the quality of the sound was poor.... this happens frequently.  I did not have the same problem with the iphone 6s.... perhaps the microphone is faulty...I even switched-off the \"background noise\" filter facility,,,, considering that the basic purpose of the phone is to make and receive calls, the positives mentioned above become irrelevant!I am very disappointed with this purchase and will be referring the matter to the regional apple supplier.  I have heard similar complaints from other executives who have the same phone....I will update this commentary if the experience improves!', 'Just got my iPhone X yesterday as an upgrade to a still fully functional iPhone 6+. Is it a good phone? Certainly. Definitely in the top 5 out there. The point is, if you are like me, your phone is a utilitarian device. As such the iPhone X is really not a very impressive upgrade from the iPhone 6+. Is the screen better? Yes but so what? The 6+ screen was fine and the differences, as a practical matter, are not important. It is faster but the 6+ was more than fast enough. Better cameras. Sure. But who cares? The 6+ cameras were good enough. Aesthetics are better but, again, not earth shattering and not worth a premium upgrade. The UI changes are a PIA. Sure, you can learn them but I can’t say they are better - just different. Why fix something that was not broken. Battery life is not substantially different. All in all, was it worth the upgrade? Not really. This is not saying the iPhone X is not a good phone. It is but it as a practical matter, the functionality of the improvement is marginal at best. I think Apple has run out of ideas or this product category is now so mature that there is little useful innovation left to squeeze out. What would be impressive and ground breaking? Radically improved radio performance or battery life. That would make for a marked improvement in utility.', 'I\\'m not one to take the time to complain, but this experience has driven me so crazy, I need a this platform to vent the worst buying experience I\\'ve ever had . And so the story beginsOnce upon a time I bought a brand spanking new iPhone X. Just like how i always buy a lot of very very expensive stuff. Sometimes very expensive stuff doesn\\'t work out of the box. Its kind of a bummer, but oh well, just send it to the manufacturer and it should come back a fixed phone right? NOPE!!!! Its exactly the same with a different serial number and big list of replaced parts. They claim its a completely different phone. so it must be a software issue right? NOPE!!!! I spent many upon many hours with several senior advisors trouble shooting this issue. So we sent it back to the manufacture again. That should be the end of the story right? NOPE !!!!! SAME THING!!! Different serial number, same list of replaced parts. So i did the very thing i didn\\'t have time for in the first place. I drove three hours to the apple in Reno and asked for my money back. They said \" are you sure, we can fix it right here in the store \".  so i said sure be my guest. They came back and said \" Sir there are signs of water damage which voids the warranty. The repairs will cost $1,300\".(Some of you reading this are probably thinking at this point.\" No way. this guy is just an apple hater\". I love apple ! Im typing this right now on a brand new 2017 Mac Pro. Anyways, back to the story.)So i said to the apple guy. \" This came in this morning. i peeled the plastic off and everything. there was never any water anywhere near this thing. And how could it cost more for something that came brand spanking new from an authorized repair center in Fort Worth, TX this morning to fix then it would be to buy a whole new one\" he said \" Parts cost $1200 and labor $100\". They would give me my money back. They didn\\'t care if i active the phone 20 times. They didn\\'t care if its been to a repair center twice. They just wanted test my pockets and my patients.The phone now sits on a shelf collecting dust while i currently use my iPhone 6 which works perfectly fine. I wish i could say this was some what exaggerated, but its not . This really happened to me. I used to love apple, but now I\\'m convinced that there thieves and they don\\'t have your best interest at heart either.', 'Why my iphone has a tmobile chip  Inside??? I dont understand because is new that wouldnt happend !!!!', 'Worst phone i have ever had. Bought it directly from Verizon. The face recognition is decent but it tries to constantly recognize your face and when you try to use it, you have to use your password at that point. Screen sensitivity gives me all kinds if trouble for mobile gaming. Should be a lot better for the price point. I would recommend anything else.', 'I upgraded from the iPhone 6+ to the X at full price through AT&T. It took nearly 6 weeks to receive. It is significantly small than the iPhone 6 plus by size. The actual screen dimensions is about the same. Yes, the color is somewhat brighter but the clarity and brightness is not (even with adjustments). Simple to set up and outside of no home button (swipe up), it is essentially the same layout. I would agree with other reviewers, it is no faster than the older model. The camera does produce a nicer photo but is this device worth $1300 for a better camera? I do not think so. You could purchase an even nicer camera for less. Facial recognition is fair to good but far from perfect. I ended up switching to digital security since I use the phone for work. I need as close to absolute security as possible. Speaker sound is better in volume and clarity. As you go from screen to screen (different applications), you can literally feel the phone shake like one use to feel hard drives activate in older laptops. I do not know what is up with this since in all my previous iPhones I never felt any mechanical movement from the phone itself. Everything works appropriately but this brief vibration is more annoying to me than the absence of the home button and being able to turn the phone off my pressing one button instead of two. Bad workmanship to engineering. Bottom line: if you do not absolutely have to upgrade your phone or you are not receiving the phone free (AT&T is giving a free iPhone 8 with an added line), then I would wait for the next generation. A larger phone is anticipated with the \"X\" features but I must admit I find the \"X\" is under-featured when it comes to being a pivotal new generation of iPhones. The iPhone X is anything but pivotal, ground breaking (outside of dropping it, it will indeed break) or full of new useful features you do not already have on your current iPhone. Even if I had to upgrade I would go with the iPhone 8 plus over the \"X\" since you keep the home button and larger size is nice for jacket pocket and those with bigger hands. To say I am disappointed in the iPhone X is an understatement. I have monitors which are more impressive than this phone\\'s screen and cost a third of this phone. In my world, I have already abandoned the Apple laptops and iMacs for my workplace and home for similar unimpressive advancements in technology. I am now going to do the same with my phones as well. Will try Samsung and other models for the future. Apple is loosing their magic touch since the loss of Steve Jobs. Some individuals do indeed make a company great. I have little doubt Jobs would have been very unhappy with this iPhone and would never have released it but made the company wait 6-12 months to have something truly better than the status quo. Otherwise it is my conviction this model was put out to make money and all of us fools who fell for this are now truly paying the price. This is a turning point for me with Apple. I am done with their products. I am done with iTunes (music). \"Alexa, never order any more Apple products for me! And please play current hits and call my office.\"', 'Dear Apple,I was out of the country with my family on vacation when my phone got a few water drops on it and completely shut off and stopped working. At this moment, I was very upset with my phone and with Apple, but I was hopeful that I would be helped when I got back in the states. Fast forward a few days later, obviously very tough days being out of the country without a working phone, and I finally got off a plane and went straight to an apple store. Going into the apple store, I was very willing to share my story with the employees and the manager. How can Apple say a phone is water resistant up to 3 feet when it can break when it gets a few drops of water on it? I told the employees this, and they did not seem surprised at all. They basically told me it was my fault the phone broke, and I argued with them saying that apple false advertised. The employees wouldnt do much to help me, I was leaving for college the next day and needed a phone, they wanted me to pay 1,000$ for a new phone. The employees were unwilling to help, so was the manager. My experience with the Iphone X and apple in general has just been terrible. I am super fed up with apple and I really cannot believe how poorly I was treated. I have had an Iphone for the last 8 years, and the service has always been okay, but now Apple made a false claim and somehow that was my fault and I needed to pay for it. I still love the products Apple makes but I am fed up with the service and the treatment and the dishonesty. As of right now I still do not have a working phone, and I just am so frustrated with everyone. They left me with nothing, basically told me to pay for a new phone, and I just cannot do that right now. I feel so unwanted from Apple, like they do not care about their customers and they dont care about service. It feels bad to be irrelevant and have no one trying to help you.', \"Too buggy. I liked my iPhone 8 better. The top part of the screen seems like such a waste. It looks cool, but still. I was hoping to have a solid contender to the Pixel 2 XL that Google sent me to beta test, but it didn't seem to match up. The display itself on the iPhone X is beautiful. The colors are a bit better than the Pixel 2 XL's, but not enough to look past the other shortcomings. The camera on the iPhone X is really cool, but for the type of photos I like to take, the Pixel 2 XL's camera wins.If I still had my iPhone 8, I would definitely prefer it over the iPhone X.I think Apple went a little too high on the cost at first and didn't properly delegate their time on the other aspects of the device that were also important.I know Apple will quickly fix the bugs and weird quirks the iPhone X has now, but it would've been nice to feel like the money was well spent when I received it.I'll update my review in a month.\", 'The phone wouldn’t charge and the screen freezes to much', 'Phone is over heating to 94 degrees', 'Bull', 'It’s slower to start up and the facial recognition only works part of the time.

Apple is a hardware and software company best known for its series of hardware products which include the iPhone smartphone, the iPad tablet computer, the Mac personal computer, the iPod portable media player, the Apple Watch smartwatch, the Apple TV digital media player, and the HomePod smart speaker.

Its online services include the iTunes Store, the iOS App Store and Mac App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud. Apple is also known for its innovative marketing strategies for its products. In my opinion, Apple has the most reliable and efficient products compared to all other major developers in the electronic industry. I believe this because Apple has affordable prices, advanced technology, and multiple models to choose from.Apple was founded by Steven Jobs and Stephen Wozniak in Cupertino, California. Jobs and Wozniak went to high school together and began working together making computers in Job’s garage. They created a modern-looking computer in a plastic case and named it the Apple Computer in 1976. The company quickly grew to have over 1000 employees by 1980 but, business didn’t pick up until 1997 after Jobs introduced the colorful iMac, which sold more than 6 million units. On October 23, 2001, Apple introduced the iPod digital music player. Several updated models have since been introduced, and the iPod brand is now the market leader in portable music. More than 350 million iPods have shipped as of September 2012. Apple has partnered with Nike to offer the Nike+iPod Sports Kit, which allows people to synchronize and monitor their workouts with iTunes and the Nike+ website. As of today, only the iPod Touch is available for purchase. Apples most sold products would be the iPhone, the first-generation iPhone was released on June 29, 2007, for $499 with only 4 gigabytes (GB) of memory and $599 with 8 gigabytes of memory. It was only offered through an AT&T contract. On February 5, 2008, it was updated to have 16 gigabytes of memory, in addition to the 8 and 4 gigabyte models. Since 2000 Apple has released 21 different models of the iPhone, 16 models of the iPad, 19 models of the iPod, 8 models of the iWatch, and the MacBook has 46 desktop models and 19 portable models. With all the different models that Apple offers customers people can pick between many different products that meets their needs.Apple has prices affordable to all people. The newer the products are the higher the prices are because they are the most recent models. The iPhone Xs, iPhone Xs Max, and iPhone Xr are the most recent iPhones which were released in September of 2018. For example, the prices for the iPhone Xs range from $899 to $1349, the iPhone Xs Max and iPhone Xr prices range from $999 to $1449. Apple offers different features like the color and number of gigabits for each model, these features can change the price more or less. Many apple retailers offer monthly payment plans, with most monthly payment plans customers have the options of 6 month, 12 month, or 24 month plans. This is offered from Apple for almost all products and models. Apple also offers a protection coverage program called Apple Care which is only covers the protection, repairs and, replacement of the device for 1 year and up to 90 days of over the phone technical support. To extend this coverage past 1 year, customers can purchase AppleCare+. With AppleCare+ all replacements and repairs are offered at a discounted price. A coverage program is a genius idea because accidents happen all the time and the feeling of knowing that you’re covered in case something does happen is worth the extra $150 that Apple charges for insurance.Each product that Apple releases offers the most advanced technology of its time. Some of the features that apple offers are not available with other brands or are significantly less in quality. The advanced technology offered includes 2436 by 1125-pixel resolution at 458 ppi, OLED multi touch display, 3D touch, A12 bionic chip, 2x optical zoom, slo-mo video support, portrait mode with advanced depth control, face identification, wireless charging, group video chat, extended battery life and many more features.

The iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max features Super Retina displays, a faster and improved dual camera system that offers breakthrough photo and video features, the first 7-nanometer chip in a smartphone, A12 Bionic chip, faster Face ID, wider stereo sound and introduces Dual SIM to iPhone. The iPhone XR comes in an all-screen glass and aluminum design with the most advanced LCD in a smartphone featuring a 6.1-inch Liquid Retina display, A12 Bionic chip with next-generation Neural Engine, a True Depth camera, Face ID and an advanced camera system that creates dramatic portraits using a single camera lens.In conclusion Apple is a hardware and software company best known for its series of hardware products which include the iPhone smartphone, the iPad tablet computer, the Mac personal computer, the iPod portable media player, the Apple Watch smartwatch, the Apple TV digital media player, and their innovative marketing strategies for its products.

Some people would consider Apple products to be expensive but when you consider all the variety and features that are offered, they’re worth every penny. In my opinion Apple has the most reliable and efficient products compared to all the major developers in the electronic industry. I believe this because Apple has affordable prices, advanced technology, and multiple models to choose from.\", 'I would like to test out this new phone before buying another expensive i phone.

I got the phone home anxiously opened it up and went to the camera functions right away since that's all I care about, a phone is just a phone otherwise. Well, I shot some 4k footage, looked nice but now I need to see how creative I can get. I looked for the manual shutter speed control, there isn't one. I looked for the manual white balance, there isn't one. I looked. I looked for the manual ISO setting, not there. I looked for the manual aperture setting, doesn't have it. So basically its camera is not intended for any kind of production, it's really a point and shoot. The HDR feature is nice but again, no manual settings. Not production friendly at all. 3 hours later I repacked it and returned it and got the LGV40.

Do I regret it?Pros:Amazing displayExceptionally fastBeautiful design and form factor (bigger display but smaller form is very helpful)Videos are outstandingCamera is world class and photos amazingWireless charging very helpfulCons:Face ID works but is much slower than fingerprint sensor and a little annoyingBattery life is ok, not great, but not on par with 8+Heats up due to glass back when doing any processes that require itDesign is beautiful but glass back makes it incredibly slippery requiring a case to hide that designLet me just say that despite it’s amazing display, I should have gone with the 8+.  The Face ID is just not on par with fingerprint sensor.  It works, but requires the extra step of swiping up after looking at it.  Maybe I’m just being way too picky but when you are used to just placing your thumb and opening instantly every time, it’s the one thing they just drives me crazy.You get used to the other gestures but again, just not as simple as using the 7 or 8.Would I buy it again?  Probably not especially at the cost and extra $250 vs the 8+ which doesn’t have the screen of the X but pretty much everything else.  While maybe not a big deal to some, I just can’t get past the Face ID being more of a gimmick then a necessity and I fear that’s the future of all iPhones like removal of the headphone jack.', \"Bought the iPhone X and immediately had problems with it. The unit wouldn't recognize cellular data, even after set-up via wifi. Ran all the tests and then reformatted it. Still nothing. Using a news reader app on wifi shouldn't take that much power, but after 10 minutes the phone was so hot I could barely hold it. Kudos to the Apple store for excellent customer service, though. For $1,200 it should work straight out of the box. It didn't. I'm not going to waste time with troubleshooting or a new one. That money is now back in my pocket.\", 'I want to start out by saying that I’m a binge Apple “fanboy” and own more Apple products then an average consumer.My first impressions with the iPhone X are great despite to some annoying OS bugs and I would highly recommend the phone. The full screen OLED display is killer and it’s a must experience.My main compliant is that my screen has a ton of scratches on it after a month of a regular use. I work in the office and I keep my phone in my pocket like most of us do. To be homesbe, my iPhkne 6s has resisted scratches for over 2 years and the X started showin scratches within the first few weeks. This is a huge disappointment and it takes away from the beautiful experience of the display. #disapointed', 'Dear Apple,I was out of the country with my family on vacation when my phone got a few water drops on it and completely shut off and stopped working. At this moment, I was very upset with my phone and with Apple, but I was hopeful that I would be helped when I got back in the states. Fast forward a few days later, obviously very tough days being out of the country without a working phone, and I finally got off a plane and went straight to an apple store. Going into the apple store, I was very willing to share my story with the employees and the manager. How can Apple say a phone is water resistant up to 3 feet when it can break when it gets a few drops of water on it? I told the employees this, and they did not seem surprised at all. They basically told me it was my fault the phone broke, and I argued with them saying that apple false advertised. The employees wouldnt do much to help me, I was leaving for college the next day and needed a phone, they wanted me to pay 1,000$ for a new phone. The employees were unwilling to help, so was the manager. My experience with the Iphone X and apple in general has just been terrible. I am super fed up with apple and I really cannot believe how poorly I was treated. I have had an Iphone for the last 8 years, and the service has always been okay, but now Apple made a false claim and somehow that was my fault and I needed to pay for it. I still love the products Apple makes but I am fed up with the service and the treatment and the dishonesty.', \"The X replaced my 5S. Looking back, it wasn't quite worth it. But pictures at night are better, for sure. But nothing else is really better on a day to day basis. However, now my playlists were deleted from my music, all of them. Checking on the internet I find I am not the only one infuriated by this, and basically there is nothing to be done about it. I hate to go to Goolag and Microsoft.Meanwhile connecting through Bluetooth is a hit and miss proposition (and again I checked for internet solutions, and basically found a wall of frustration and no solutions  - turn the phone off and on, turn the speaker off and on- that worked). I'm going to look up whether there is any sort of Apple shorting in the financial markets based on Apple's weird habit to punish some percentage of customers randomly.But aside from that delivering this sort of gratuitous misery to customers reminds me Apple is part of a huge monopoly/oligopoly sorely in need of taxation and regulation, something like the railroads of yesterday.\", 'I bought my iPhone X from Apple, so I\\'m not shown as a verified purchaser by Amazon. I\\'d rate it 5 stars except the screen developed a hairline crack just two months after I got it even though it\\'s never been dropped. Apple, of course, will not do anything about that since they only have my word that it hasn\\'t been dropped. It has been in my pocket much of the time and, with that big screen, it may have stressed the screen a bit when I sat down, etc. But the screen should be able to withstand minor stresses like that! Even worse, four months later, it developed a second hairline crack, again without ever being dropped. Right now, the phone is 100% usable since I have to look very carefully to see the hairline crack, and can only see it (just barely) with a totally black screen. But I worry that this is going to get worse. I hope I am an unusual case, but found a couple of other complaints here about \"screen lifting\" and similar. It seems like Apple needs to improve the screen durability.Other than this issue, I love the phone. The screen is big, especially compared to the physical dimensions. When my Kindle broke recently (I left it on a chair and sat on it – not wise!), instead of buying a new one I started using my iPhone X to read Kindle books. I like it even better than my old Kindle Voyage. The screen is a bit smaller, but much sharer and brighter. And \"my Kindle\" is always with me!Camera is great, but you know that and much more from reviews. Mostly I wanted to register my concern about the screen and, if others experience the same problem, maybe Apple will respond.', 'It was good', 'The phone is a really great device. I love all of the new things that apple has started doing with the x like, how you can create your own emoji! I can go on and on about how I love the x but, there are some problems. The speaker will start to become weaker and weaker until you basically have to use headphones to hear it. The Face ID is not as fast or as great as you think. It takes a good minute to recognize sometimes. The battery runs out extremely fast. And the worst thing I hav experienced is not being able to text people that don’t have iPhones. It’s a struggle because when you first get your phone it’s great you can do everything and before you know it you can’t text anyone other than apple users. My opinion is to just wait don’t het the x wait for the XS Max.', 'You expect for +1000 for it to at least do basic functions like connect to WiFi but can’t even do that. At least once a day the Bluetooth/ WiFi antennae stops working and the phone will crash, you have to turn it completely off. Not to mention all the other problems like the fact that native iPhone apps crash even 9 months after the release. Also noticed it becoming much slower. Needless to say I will no longer be purchasing iPhones.', 'Not a fan of the fragile glass back which costs 550 dollars and a complete disassembly/chassis replacement to fix. That is a massive design failure by making something that should be user replaceable such as the iPhone 4s back. Now I’m left with a shattered phone which can’t be fixed. It’s a good thing I have a phone case to stop me from cutting my hands, otherwise it would be a safety hazard. FYI, this happened with my case on. If you choose to have Apple fix this issue they will be replacing the entire phone which is environmentally irresponsible and greedy by pocketing 160 of that 550 you paid.Besides that this is a solid phone comparatively, I do like the stainless steel frame over their aluminum from the past but wish that I could omit wireless charging and have the stainless steel material throughout.', 'overprice....  more expensive than the new Iphone.. crazy', '0:100:00This video is not intended for all audiences.

My next phone will not be an Apple phone !!!', \"I have had the x for sometime now.  I can say that of all the iphones, the x is my biggest disappointment. I do not always get text messages, my reminders may or may not notify me, I can no longer send a text with the special effects, etc.  This morning my alarm sounded for maybe two seconds and then just shut off.  I have been told to bring it back due to it being a hardware issue.  Now, I get that these things may happen on occasion but the fact that close to 50% of people that I know that did splurge for the x are having issues.  Some, including my husband, are opting not to make a swap because they don't really care about the special effects???  It's more than that.  I feel this product was prematurely released and I not happy.  The not having a home button is an adjustment, can't say I'm a fan.  The face recognition is awful.  I feel that it is a HUGE safety concern.  If someone grabs your phone, be it your child in school and whether it be horsing around or not, they grab the phone and unlock it with your face and run off.  A young mom, walking with a stroller and small toddler in tow, gets mugged, a shopper distracted on their phone and a thug steels it.  These are all legit concerns.  Yes, you can opt to not use it, which my family has done.  I am truly disappointed.  I called Apple customer care and was told that they have received many calls like mine.  The x by far being the most complaints with hardware issues.  Save your money and get the 8 or maybe try another brand but do not waste your money on the x.\", 'My iPhone X expierence so far. Preordered on Oct. 27th and managed to get a Gray/Black 256GB Iphone X. Finally arrives on the 6th and I don’t get a chance to open it up and attempt to hook up my new phone until the 11th. So here I go beaming with excitement to check out my new device that just cost me the equivalent of a house payment. Open it up and everything looks good at first and then I use my iPhone 6S light to look at the screen for any dust as I’ve already gotten a screen protector in hand to put on my new device before I even get started. Then I see it. A very very small scratch or crack under the screen coming from the notch area at the top of the phone coming down maybe 1/2 a cm long. So I schedule an appointment to talk to an Apple rep. for 8:45am and he finally calls me at 8:48am. I explain to him what I observed on my phone and he doesn’t seem to thrilled to help me out today. Maybe because it’s a Saturday and he’s at work. During our conversation he makes a statement that I didn’t really care for. Such as... Maybe the delivery man dropped your package and maybe that’s what happened. Obviously this is a manufacturing defect since it’s under the screen. So I get two options. Option A) Send my phone in to be repaired and who knows how long that will take and why would I want a brand new item I just paid a lot of money for to be repaired due to a defect. Option B) Go to the Apple Store and have them look at it and I can try and request a new phone. Oh and the next available time I can get an appointment is 4 days away and I’ll have to take off work early to resolve an Apple manufacturing defect. So I guess we will see how my Apple Store experience goes. I’ve had an Apple phone going back to the 3GS days and I’ve dealt with Apple Customer Service in the past with no issues but so far I’d have to say I’m extremely disappointed in the quality control of the IPhone X and the customer service expierence with Apple.

The new glass case is beautiful. I also like the display as it is crisper and the color is perfect on the screen. I purchased a gold phone for my wife and a silver phone for myself.This phone is fast. Don’t believe other comments you might see because I officially rate and run speed tests on my phones.  The gold phone, we purchased, is rated the fastest phone smart phone in the world at this time. It’s Antutu rating is 219575 and the second silver phone is rated at 216318.  This phone just blows away my iPhone 7 Plus with speed and downloading apps and animation quality. My old iPhone 7 Plus was rated at 178438. This speed is due to the new A11 Bionic chip with 64 bit architecture.This phone has the new bluetooth 5 which succeeds bluetooth 4.2. Bluetooth 5 is backward compatible to the previous versions. The new bluetooth has twice the speed of the 4.2 version and about 4 times the range. That is amazing since it uses less power and its message capacity is 255 bytes versus 31 bytes which makes the data payload of the 4.2 version rated at 20 bytes max. This is a major distance and data transmission increase in performance. I notice it when I lay down my phone and walk away and my Apple Watch 3 is still connected when before I would lose connection with my older iPhone.The phone is designed to be IP67 for splash, water and dust resistant. The camera is still 12 MP but it has excellent performance with optical zoom and digital zoom up to 10 times. It also still has the portrait camera mode with the blurred background Bokeh effect by using both of the rear cameras. It even uses the new portrait lighting mode to make your photos look more professional.In the video recording mode I really like the 4K video recording with 30 or 60 fps.  Of course you still have the front facing camera with 7MP quality for face time or selfie photography. The slow motion mode is nice when shooting sports events or shooting wildlife videos.The phone is slightly larger but is still fits into most of your iPhone 7 Plus cases. The new iPhone 8 Plus weighs just a bit more at 7.12 ounces versus 6.63 ounces.  The battery life is the same in the specs but for me it seems to be a bit longer at 22.4 hours. The rating is 21 hours.The new phone is only available in 64 GIG or 256 GIG storage capacity.Overall this is a great phone. I am happy with our new phones and it is a good upgrade in power and performance.', \"My daughter was so surprised! She loves this phone. We've offered to update with the new X and she's declined.

You can't charge the phone and use your headphones at the same time, unless you use a wireless charging pad, which you can't use if you use those magnetic car phone holders (if you cover the spot).  The camera is better than my 6Plus, so is the battery. Love the extra Ram and processing power. Just don't understand the lunacy of getting rid of the headphone jack.I'm also not a fan of iOS11. The update added extra wording that eats into Messages, and other screen areas. You can't click on an address and have it map it like it did in the 6 and 6S.You can't have your phone plugged in the car to charge and use for directions and use headphones.

Got an invite from my friend and then decided to buy it. With it for around 3 days and loving it. It\\'s super power house - octa core processor with 4 GB RAM and 64 GB storage with no bloat ware. I had some tough time to decide among this, Moto X Pure Edition and Asus Zenphone 2 - this time I was in no mood to buy $750-$800 Samsung or Apple. I paid around $406(no tax but around $17.xx as S&H fees). It arrived within a week from China.Pros:1) Very smooth screen2) Very powerful phone - very smooth in operation.3) Metallic edges - so looks premium quality.4) Voice, music and speakerphone of good quality.5) Camera - 13 MP and 5 MP..not top of the line but still good enough. Good laser auto focus and overall good quality6) Very good size battery - easily lasting for more than a day. For me battery is very important - a phone should be smart in terms of battery usage.7) Android Lollipop is very good.8) Improvement over oneplus1 as same screen but phone size is reduced. I am able to do one hand operation9) Android/Oxygen has very good default features OOTB.10) wifi connection and signals better than my Samsung Galaxy S4.11) Most of the stuff like setting up AT&T was done by it\\'s own...i don\\'t have to do anything at all.Cons:1) Charger is different than regular USB charger...so you need to carry your own-can\\'t borrow other\\'s.2) It\\'s not a major improvement over oneplus one at least in terms of features.3) Missing NFC, Quick charge and could have better camera, quick charge at least.4) Support sucks...sometimes on chat - it says more than 26 hours of wait time...though you will be able to get to them in around 30-45 minutes.5) Just too much responsive...they have placed - air plane mode button which sometimes is getting touched a bit while in the call...which disconnects...sort of annoying...it\\'s very sensitive and fast phoneOverall it\\'s a very good phone at least price wise. Won\\'t be going back to Apple or Samsung in future as more or less there are some really good options available in sub $400 range now.Update on July 2016.On 4th June 2016 there was a 1.1 GB update of this phone. After that no ring on the incoming calls.After June update I don\\'t have ring for incoming calls. Any time any app is getting updated then also ringtone goes away. Tried everything, I was not not knowing the twitter support is good...at least somebody is there is there to respond. The email support and phone support sucks for OnePlus in USA though phone support for OnePlus is good in india. Also india service centers are very good...I was travelling to India for Work and vacation during June and first half of July, 2016. I called Customer Service and was able to talk to Mr. Mohan Kumar who assigned it the case # 301052.Followed all the tricks on each and every forum...but any app which is getting updated..i am having nightmares with this phone not having ring for incoming calls...i am too busy and any such missed call is really very problematic. Tried this one: try performing the below mentioned troubleshooting steps?1.Settings > Sound & notification > Phone ringtone > Select \"OnePlus tune\".2. Settings > Sound & notification > Default notification ringtone > Select \"Free\".Once it works, please change the desired ringtone from the setting again. and also reboot-->Volume Down-->wipe cache data with priority notification in middle. But nothing worked for me. I disabled all the apps auto update also but no success.  I am suffering for around 2 months now. Work/life and everything is impacted - if some smart phone feature doesn\\'t work then it\\'s fine but if the basic phone - calling and receiving is not working then it\\'s a big issue. Other issue the phone\\'s battery is really getting weak..now it lasts only 6 hours...when it was new it used to go upto 10-11 hours but now it\\'s not lasting beyond 6 hours. As the battery is not replaceable it causes issues. As there is no fast charging for this phone - i need to charge it for full 2.5 hours to get 85% of the battery.

Both the sides shipping was taken care of by OnePlus. It took 2.5 weeks for me to get back the phone - they don\\'t offer any loner phone. I asked them only two things :1) for incoming calls it should ring 2) Battery is getting discharged very easily. Too my surprise nothing has been repaired. The repair center in Florida is good for nothing - they didn\\'t even tested the phone and sent it back...still no ring for incoming calls. Called OnePlus support at the us number (646) 851-2228 - call gets routed to china where you can hear a lot of background noise...these folks are once again asking me to send this phone for repair which might take another 2.5 or 3 weeks. With no trust on this company and this device - i asked them politely to refund or send me a replacement device...they said talk to corporate office in Schenzen, China. they don\\'t have any email id for them and moreover it should be them who should have done that...i have given up on this hyped chineese toys which is good for nothing...in india they say that chineese products cannot be trusted...so now i understand where they are coming from. OnePlus please stop making phones and definitely hire smart capable repair folks and customer service also.update on 26th Aug 2016Sent this device for repair twice to them - first time to Florida and then to Texas address but none of the time it was fixed. Worst thing - you need to ship your phone and be away from phone for 2.5 to 3 weeks...every time I send them the details about the problem and it\\'s the same problem-that there is no incoming ring tone when somebody calls me. After 2.5 or 3 weeks it will be shipped back to you without any notice. In case of oneplus support - twitter, email, phone support doesn\\'t talk to each other...none of them are aware what is going on...first time they did the factory reset and then second time re-installed the Operating system. But the problem is not resolved. How come a O/S upgrade can screw up the ring for incoming calls...that is beyond imagination...clearly they have messed up big time with their O/S rather than using pure Android O/S....this is ridiculous state of customer service/support.NEVER EVER BUY ANY PHONE FROM THIS COMPANY....YOU WILL END TALKING TO SOME FOLKS WHO ONLY SPEAKS ENGLISH IN MANDARIN WAY.', 'Good phone.

For me battery is very important - a phone should be smart in terms of battery usage.7) Android Lollipop is very good.8) Improvement over oneplus1 as same screen but phone size is reduced. I am able to do one hand operation9) Android/Oxygen has very good default features OOTB.10) wifi connection and signals better than my Samsung Galaxy S4.11) Most of the stuff like setting up AT&T was done by it\\'s own...i don\\'t have to do anything at all.Cons:1) Charger is different than regular USB charger...so you need to carry your own-can\\'t borrow other\\'s.2) It\\'s not a major improvement over oneplus one at least in terms of features.3) Missing NFC, Quick charge and could have better camera, quick charge at least.4) Support sucks...sometimes on chat - it says more than 26 hours of wait time...though you will be able to get to them in around 30-45 minutes.5) Just too much responsive...they have placed - air plane mode button which sometimes is getting touched a bit while in the call...which disconnects...sort of annoying...it\\'s very sensitive and fast phoneOverall it\\'s a very good phone at least price wise. Won\\'t be going back to Apple or Samsung in future as more or less there are some really good options available in sub $400 range now.Update on July 2016.On 4th June 2016 there was a 1.1 GB update of this phone. After that no ring on the incoming calls.After June update I don\\'t have ring for incoming calls. Any time any app is getting updated then also ringtone goes away. Tried everything, I was not not knowing the twitter support is good...at least somebody is there is there to respond. The email support and phone support sucks for OnePlus in USA though phone support for OnePlus is good in india. Also india service centers are very good...I was travelling to India for Work and vacation during June and first half of July, 2016. I called Customer Service and was able to talk to Mr. Mohan Kumar who assigned it the case # 301052.Followed all the tricks on each and every forum...but any app which is getting updated..i am having nightmares with this phone not having ring for incoming calls...i am too busy and any such missed call is really very problematic. Tried this one: try performing the below mentioned troubleshooting steps?1.Settings > Sound & notification > Phone ringtone > Select \"OnePlus tune\".2. Settings > Sound & notification > Default notification ringtone > Select \"Free\".Once it works, please change the desired ringtone from the setting again. and also reboot-->Volume Down-->wipe cache data with priority notification in middle. But nothing worked for me. I disabled all the apps auto update also but no success.  I am suffering for around 2 months now. Work/life and everything is impacted - if some smart phone feature doesn\\'t work then it\\'s fine but if the basic phone - calling and receiving is not working then it\\'s a big issue. Other issue the phone\\'s battery is really getting weak..now it lasts only 6 hours...when it was new it used to go upto 10-11 hours but now it\\'s not lasting beyond 6 hours. As the battery is not replaceable it causes issues. As there is no fast charging for this phone - i need to charge it for full 2.5 hours to get 85% of the battery. I need to carry the charger everywhere as the battery performance is going down. At jaipur india - the support fixed the volume button otherwise the phone was not even booting up. Never had this much headache with any phone. Now finally Oneplus accepted the fault and ready to repair...which may take 3 weeks...so i need to look for alternate phone(oneplus not ready for loner phone also)...simply put in least words...oneplus messed up big time with the update - no testing done prior to update...worst their support is not at all good in usa..customer is very much on their own with these kind of phone...not at all a flagship killer according to me.Update on 8th Aug 2016.I finally sent this phone for repair. Both the sides shipping was taken care of by OnePlus. It took 2.5 weeks for me to get back the phone - they don\\'t offer any loner phone. I asked them only two things :1) for incoming calls it should ring 2) Battery is getting discharged very easily. Too my surprise nothing has been repaired. The repair center in Florida is good for nothing - they didn\\'t even tested the phone and sent it back...still no ring for incoming calls. Called OnePlus support at the us number (646) 851-2228 - call gets routed to china where you can hear a lot of background noise...these folks are once again asking me to send this phone for repair which might take another 2.5 or 3 weeks. With no trust on this company and this device - i asked them politely to refund or send me a replacement device...they said talk to corporate office in Schenzen, China. they don\\'t have any email id for them and moreover it should be them who should have done that...i have given up on this hyped chineese toys which is good for nothing...in india they say that chineese products cannot be trusted...so now i understand where they are coming from. OnePlus please stop making phones and definitely hire smart capable repair folks and customer service also.update on 26th Aug 2016Sent this device for repair twice to them - first time to Florida and then to Texas address but none of the time it was fixed. Worst thing - you need to ship your phone and be away from phone for 2.5 to 3 weeks...every time I send them the details about the problem and it\\'s the same problem-that there is no incoming ring tone when somebody calls me. After 2.5 or 3 weeks it will be shipped back to you without any notice. In case of oneplus support - twitter, email, phone support doesn\\'t talk to each other...none of them are aware what is going on...first time they did the factory reset and then second time re-installed the Operating system. But the problem is not resolved. How come a O/S upgrade can screw up the ring for incoming calls...that is beyond imagination...clearly they have messed up big time with their O/S rather than using pure Android O/S....this is ridiculous state of customer service/support.NEVER EVER BUY ANY PHONE FROM THIS COMPANY....YOU WILL END TALKING TO SOME FOLKS WHO ONLY SPEAKS ENGLISH IN MANDARIN WAY.', 'Good phone. A little on the large size. The finger print scanner is not as good as other phones.', 'Was not up to par with website specifications and details', 'Disappointing phone. Software is horrible. Support is worse.', 'it sucks', \"I have had my Oneplus One for over two years now.  The 2 is a huge disappointment! Once you've experienced the joy of Cyanogenmod,  Oxygen OS just sucks! It is vastly inferior.  No customization,  no privacy controls,  no nothing.  They also removed NFC.  Going backwards and removing NFC was a huge mistake. How is the successor going to be missing features the original had? I made the mistake of buying the 2 last fall and feel betrayed by OnePlus.  They got us hooked on an amazing product at an amazing price.  Then they put out this hunk of junk. Dual Sim is about all it has going for it.To be fair,  if this is your first smartphone,  or your first upgrade in years,  you should be happy with it. If you loved your OnePlus One and expect an improved experience,  you have been warned.\", \"The phone is nice and works good but:The back camera turned blurry so I have to take it to warranty, and the customer service is terrible:- I have to wait about an hour to be attended to put the warranty request.- They ask you to do a hard reset which delete everything you have in your phone so make sure you backup everything.- Then they schedule a remote support where someone connects to your computer and tells you to connect your phone to perform some software update (didn't work) it takes 1hr- The last thing is they send to you a label to ship your device without any accessory which is frustrating I have to take off the screen protector which wasn't easy to remove plus how I'm going to install it again without the tools.Each of these steps takes a week between, looks like they don't have enough people or they have a big amount or request for customers.If you got luck and your phone works fine thats a 4 star instead of 2, but if something wrong is happening with it everything sucks.\", 'No NFC = no flagship', \"This particular phone came with Hydrogen OS (very poor with features). Luckily, Oxygen installation takes 30 minutes at most, once you download ~780MB ROM.Also, both Hydrogen and Oxygen don't support notification icon badges out of the box, so you will have to use 3rd party apps for this. (I use Nova Launcher and Notifier)Hardware switch for silencing the phone has 3 positions. Normal, notify only for priorities (you can adjust what the priority is) and Don't notify at all. The thing is, if the phone deiced not to notify, it won't vibrate also. So if you actually wanted: Normal, Silence with vibration, Don't notify at all, you will have to use 3rd party app. I use Vibrate Mode.A bit older hardware shows sometimes. For instance it struggles with youtube videos on the beginning of the playback sometimes - fairly rarely. Nothing actually bothering.Apart from these, after one day of setting everything up, the phone is great (after 10 days of usage :) ). When compared to flagships, for standard usage, it actually misses nothing. Unless you really need fingerprint scanner or NFC.Display is great. I enjoy it very much.Before OnePlus x I had iPhone 5 and I find OPx a bit better, especially when it comes to display. Also Oxygen has some nice settings out of the box. Almost anything you really need (calls, messaging, camera, flash lite) is tree taps tops (usually two taps) away from the locked screen.\", 'I have been using a Nexus or HTC One phone for the past 4 years.  I recently upgraded to the MotoX but found it too big for my liking.  The OnePlus X had the right hardware, dimensions and price, and with all of the positive reviews on Amazon I decided to try it.This phone works great.  Software is quick, nice screen, battery lasts for a full day with normal use (note that I am not a heavy user), and the preloaded software is useful and doesn\\'t slow the phone down.I was worried that OnePlus would be slow to release security updates, but so far they have been pushing through 1 update a week.I highly recommend this device to anyone looking for a 5\" Android phone.', 'Love this phone!Was an iPhone user since 2008, finally switched from that crap and got an android, and what an android! Have been using it for a month now and will likely NEVER get another Apple product. Awesome optons, versatility. finally a computer in my pocket that I can do almost anything with, compared to apple which decided what I needed my phone to be, or what the GUI was to look like.Great vendor, delivered on time, as promised, good tracking. Will do business with them again anytime!!', \"Great sleek phone in proper packaging and comes with a case and durable charging cable. However, it comes with a European power adapter which I can't use in Canada, luckily I had one from my old phone but it should have been listed in the description.

Otherwise very excited to use this phone.\", \"It's really pretty, doesn't heats, is fast,  and came with all the specifications written by the seller. There is just two things: The google search bar it has on the main screen. I can't remove it. OK I can live with that, but for me you should be able to remove it. The other thing is the block screen: I can't configure it so it doesn't sound when I block the phone, or every time I touch the screen. I can live with that too. That's all by now jaja\", 'Phenomenal value for the money.

I love the camera and screen.', \"So i got this phone by an invite and i have to say it is one killer phone specially for the price. its only 250$ which came out to be 266$ and somethings cents being that i live in CA in the US. anyways let me mentions my experience with this phone after a week-The Good (not just good, amazing)--the screen is a killer being that its amoled-->you get deep blacks and rich colors.. although its 1080p its still good and at ~400ppi, you won't notice any pixels at a good distace-processor is still snappy even tho its 2 yrs old, snapdragon 801 ftw!!--> yes its the same processor used 2 yrs ago on flagships 2013 phones, i used to have a nexus 5 and it has the same performance, may notice one lag here and there but its barely noticeable-close to .. or stock android? either way your getting close to a full android experience, that being said, its snappy--> no manufacture bloatware, it also has oxygen os which is just amazing specially the customization with gestures which should actually be in all android phones. no 6.0 update yet but 5.1.1 is still keeper-build quality is spectacular but too bad it has glass front and back so i just used the included case bec. im scared to drop my phone. p--> it also has a built in screen protector, keep in mind that around the edges theres a slight bevel so be cautions in buying a screen protector because i bet most manufacturers will just fit the whole screen without taking into account the slight bevel on the edges which will rise the screen protector, thus is useless.-speakers i think is a 3.5/5, im not an audiophile but yes the speakers are good for most people who just want to watch a vid and don't care much of audio, it does distort on high levels but not all the time.-NOW** to keep in mind--LTE support, hope i can help many of you guys concerning the network issues--> this phone has LTE bands 1/2/4/5/7/8 .. now yes as you have probly read everywhere LTE is limited in the US especially when your on ATT and T-mobile because its missing bands 12 and 17.. which are the main bands of the 2 carriers. ATT heavily uses band 17 **so i can tell you right now, if you want this phone and you use att, DONT GET IT.. limited LTE support, watch pocketnows video on youtube where they are currently on att and theres limited coverage. do not get it, you won't like it unless you can deal with hspa+ and 3G, good luckBUT!!! IF YOUR ON T-MOBILE, which i currently have, Get This Phone **UNLESS you live in a rural area (but pls do still check coverage if your covered, best coverage is the citys, preferebly not inside buildings. IF YOUR CURRENTLY A TMOBILE OR ATT CUSTOMER DOWNLOAD 'LTE DISCOVERY' to check what lte band your using. then make the decisions yourself. but anyways, my experience with this device on tmobile is spectacular because i get lte everywhere. BUT KEEP IN MIND, tmobile is upgrading to band 12, they already did but its not in all cities,  and that being said you wont get lte band 12 support if they do but hey, as long as your gertting lte on your phone everywhere you go its still a keeper. i used LTE Discovery and checked everywhere i went and tmobile mainly USES BAND 4 WHICH THE ONEPLUS X HAS!!!! yay, i had great connection on my nexus 5 too, lte everywhere and it didnt even have band 12.===conclusion for the networks: get it if your on tmobile and DO NOT get if your on att, just keep in mind you wont get band 12 if tmobile upgrades to it BUT as long as you get good lte on your old phone and its not using band 12 then get it-call quality is great as always and everyday is use without notice of lag in typical tasks.--> playing games, somewhat frame drops but intensive games, lower the graphics, but yes its definitly playable-oh and yes battery life, ~2500 mah which is more than good for me, may be different for some people tho--> i get a whole day from this thing from ~4 hrs on time with just typically watching vids, searching stuff on amazon, fb and ig, so ya typical use. it will get you passed a day but if your a heavy user tone down on use or just carry an external battery charger thingy. standby time is great too-now onto camera, which is great not amazing i would still prefer my nexus 5 for video because of the one plus x's lack of video stabilization, which isnt a biggie but there was definitly less shaking on the Nexus 5 but its not that big of a difference--> photo quality is great again not amazing and is definitly good for point and shoot but professional use.. 2/5 but its alright, slow motion is like toned down quality it shoots it on 720p but looks eh and you can't adjust where the slow mo parts are which is a biggie for me bec. i sk8, timelapse mode is cool and works great, video quality is good but ya no vid stabilization and zooming in the video gets bad quality.. imagine starting at 1080p then zooming in you go down to like 480p.. but is acceptable, i havnt tried the panorama but prety sure its coo--THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND-no nfc, which isn't a biggie for me being that i don't use any of its features, well like once a month but ya-no quickcharge, maybe a big deal for some but not much for me, just carry and external battery charger but i understand its kinda an issue-dont drop it, glass front and back yup be carefulMICRO SD SLOT FTW, if your having problems with the phone not recognizing it just go to the storage settings and enable storage OTG or something like that.. MAKE SURE you updated oxygen os to the latest one because before the update the phone couldnt recognize them for some reason.<Final Words> (i live in CA in the US so ya)-get it if your on tmobile and your in an area with LTE bands 1/2/4/5/7/8 dont get it if your on 12, and check coverage for rural area if you live there. and um ya i dont recomend it on att .... and um for the people outside of US, check your coverage and stuff-and finally if you don't use stuff like nfc, quickcharge, dont mind a not bad not amazing camera then its a keeper*go on oneplus' website and check the phones info bec i probly forgot stuff haha-btw who wrote this review is my son, just under my account ,which im just in high school haha, so ya this review is from my personal experience and yep its a keeper\", \"Love the phone....

The screen had awful bug when viewing video with weird pixelation and the screen had very badly contrasted colors.But the worst part is their Customer Service. I filled a ticket to return the phone and that's were an endless exchange of email started. I followed their instructions to return the phone and I had problem with customs. The problem is that each time I asked for help they answered something that had nothing to do with my requests. They totally elude my problem and give me no solution so that I can return the phone.So I highly do not recommand this phone or this company's product to anyone. The cheap quality of their phone reflect their cheap customer service and company philosophy.\", 'If you are guys thinking to buy this mobile here are some points that might be usefulI will not comment anything about the features provided in One Plus x. But i would like to tell you about points to consider before you decide to buy this one1) The mobile looks so delicate. It just fell down after the 2nd day i bought this mobile and the back screen got broken(not sure of how muchwe need to pay to make it right)2) You just need to pay for this on your own(is not covered with warrantry). After some amount of re-search learnt that there is B2x protection forOne Plus X which can cover accidental coverage too(I advice to get this one too within 15 days of your purchase of this mobile)3) Very poor Service in India(the service is outsourced to local guys - they just keep you wait)4) I did not see any support over their official website too.', \"Phone looks good and functioned well. However the edges are sleek and quite prone to slip through hold. The LCD of the screen is broken and I cannot even repair it. The screen is cost is about 150$, it's better to buy a new one.\", 'poor, as the price sound. i bought from the site directly. dont buy this phone i just collected the phone yesterday and it is not what the adverts are. the invite is to make people curious for the Phone. Its garbage', \"So far I have to say i'm very pleased with this phone. I had a Motorola G4 before this phone, and I very much enjoyed the bone stock android operating system. If the phone hadn't fallen victim to the ghost touch issue, I'd have never upgraded. That said, the oneplus 5T has to be the best android phone you can buy for under $700. It's fast, comfortable to hold, and utterly intuitive to operate. If they waterproofed it, I think it could give Samsung a run for their money. I bought this one in particular because it is unlocked, and I spend a lot of time overseas. I have now used the dual sim feature, which works brilliantly. My only complaint, if I had to give one, is the lack of CDMA support. T-mobile was fine for the 3 weeks I spent back in the states, but Verizon would have been better suited to my needs while I was home. I have it on good authority that Verizon will work on this phone, but only on 3G. All in all, i'm still very pleased with this phone.\", \"The Good:- Totally compatible with LineageOS 15.1; everything seems to work out-of-the-box- Connected to T-Mobile right away both with LineageOS and the stock OxygenOS; no need to fiddle with APN settings or anything of the sort- Pretty good battery life (though we'll see how it holds up after a year)- USB Type-C- Dual-camera (I liked it on my HTC One M8, and I like it now)- Good performance even with relatively aggressive power saving settingsThe Bad:- Had to download a firmware update from a random XDA Developers post for (I think) the baseband before I could install LineageOSThe Ugly:- The screen is a bit long; kinda hard to reach stuff at the top of portrait mode with my thumbs (it's doable, though)- The preapplied screen protector seems to be abnormally prone to smudging- Charging with a non-Dash charger seems slower than I'd expect, even with the screen off\", 'So I received the one plus 5t and opened the box. I was expecting the phone charger to be US since it says so in the details. To my surprise when I opened the box the charger is made for UK. I was very displeased, so i talked to the seller regarding this issue. Surely, they sent me a US charger( 1-3 weeks later). I was pleased now, but felt I was cheated since I was expecting that the charger to be of US.

The phone is FAST. Faster than any mobile device you\\'ve ever owned. The fingerprint reader is the fastest in the industry. The facial recognition is accurate and lightning fast. Dash charging is AMAZING (30 minutes for a charge that lasts me well over 20 hours).The price is high, don\\'t get me wrong. But you\\'re buying a phone that\\'s on-par-with if not better-than the iPhone x, the Galaxy line, the Google Pixels, and every other flagship phone going for 800+ new.Pros:-The phone comes with no bloatware whatsoever. You\\'re getting a very true android experience. The OnePlus custom apps are high quality and unobtrusive.-The screen is BEAUTIFUL (Seriously, the AMOLED screen on this thing is the best looking screen I\\'ve ever seen on a phone).-The battery life is absolutely bonkers. I\\'m talking take it off the charger at 10am and by 10pm you\\'re only at 70%. You can use a mostly-true-black wallpaper to save battery as well, thanks to the way AMOLED screens work.-Did I mention it\\'s pretty? It\\'s thin but sturdy. The bezels are small and clean. No weird wrap-around edges or anything. Mine came with a big serial number/production info sticker on the back under the oneplus logo, which kind of blows. I could take it off but it\\'s going in a case and I\\'d rather have access to that info.-Dude I don\\'t even know what to say at this point. I am still in the honeymoon period with this phone (This is day 4 with it) so take this review with a grain of salt. But even without new phone goggles, I can see this thing lasting a while. It\\'s all-around a magnificent piece of tech. OnePlus is new to the phone game and buying this is a show of good faith and an investment in the future of mobile devices.-This is the only phone I\\'ve ever bought that comes with a case. It\\'s not a great case, but it\\'s something. It means a lot to me as a consumer, spending 600 dollars on a cell phone, that the manufacturer included some amount of protection in the box. It shows that OnePlus knows you\\'re making a big purchase, and they want you to take care of it. This is a super neat thing to me as it\\'s basically unheard of for a smartphone to come with a case.-OnePlus as a company is amazing. The customer service is tops and they push out updates faster than any other manufacturer at the moment. OnePlus is possibly the only company using android to its full potential right now. Most others, google included, are simply using it as a platform to copy whatever the iPhone does. I hate this. And I\\'m happy to spend my money with a company moving against the grain. Never Settle.Cons (so you know I\\'m not a shill):-Dash charging is definitely a little funny. Your stock cable will work 100% but it\\'s a crapshoot as to which other cables work. If you\\'re going to use dash charging, buy the cable from OnePlus. Otherwise, a nice Anker cable and brick will get you a good charge in a pinch, it\\'ll just take a bit longer.-The dash charger that comes with this one is an international charger. So be prepared for that. It does, however, come with an adapter for US plugs. And using the adapter doesn\\'t seem to slow down or inhibit dash charging at all.-USB-C is great for the user, but it\\'s a consumer nightmare right now. Be prepared to do a lot of research into cables. You can\\'t just pick these bad boys up at a gas station any more. You\\'ve got a 600+ dollar phone.-It\\'s slick yo. Without a case it feels like this phone just wants to jump out of your hand. The case it comes with isn\\'t that great either. But it comes with one.-The case selection is kind of wack because it\\'s not an iPhone or a Galaxy. But you can find some really nice ones on the oneplus website, plus here on Amazon there are a few good ones. Most OnePlus users get one of about 10 different cases, but I imagine the market will open up on those soon.-Fingerprints all over my beautiful screen. :(-I\\'ve personally never been a fan of the software menu/home/back buttons so I\\'m putting this as a con. I prefer hardware buttons at the bottom of the phone on the bezel. That being said, this phone may make me a believer soon. It\\'s so pretty.In conclusion I don\\'t have a lot to say really. 5 stars. This is a five-star phone. The term \"flagship-killer\" gets thrown around a lot when we talk about the 5 and 5t. And I think it\\'s true. This is a $650 phone that will outperform, outlast, and outshine the $1000 iPhone X. This is a phone priced fairly to the consumer, rather than priced against the iPhone. You pay what it\\'s worth, not on a scale of \"how much cheaper than the new iphone do we want to make it.\"If you hate Apple you will love this phone.I will fistfight a person over my opinion of this phone.', 'Thru a strange circumstance I\\'ve had two OnePlus 5t A5010 phones in the last 6 months, and(to say the negative firstly...)the finger unlock function has not worked on either one.That being said,  given all the other sterling aspects of the phone as described by others,(whose comments I could emulate but not further explicate,)this sucker definitely deserves 5 stars.Being a 3/4 century old retired  engineer, whose last cell phone was a \"flip phone\",I am somewhat the bonehead when it comes to the technology incorporated herein:and I have been extremely happy with the responsiveness of their tech support,to which I would give 6 stars, if possible.', 'This phone is amazing! Such an upgrade over my HTC One M8, minus the speaker which is a huge letdown but I guess they expect people to wear headphones or hook up a bluetooth speaker (yes this does have a 3.5mm (1.25inch) headphone jack for your listening pleasure).', 'This is a wonderful phone, fast response , able to handle intense gaming, sturdy and durable battery last at least 4 hours then gaming and will recharge  to 65 - 70% in 30 minsOnly down side is water proofing , it is water resistant meaning it will survive a quick dip in a tub of water  or spill but not water proof  .. but it is not like we need to go diving with our phones now do we.', \"I decided to get this phone after an extensive research in every phone currently available. After a lot of debating, I decided to get this one because it ended having the best cost per value and features I really liked. Some of those features were its metallic frame because I didn't want a phone that breaks on contact like all the toys being sold right now. Really good performance because I'm coming from a really slow phone. And best of all, it has all of the top-tier characteristics without being super expensive.So far my experience using it has been great. The most notable things are the performance and the fast charging. My battery has lasted for approximately 7 hours while fully using it. And it's so easy to just charge it for 15 minutes and having 50% or leaving it for around 30 minutes and having it being fully charged. It also handles really heavy apps, sometimes while all of them are running simultaneously.Another thing I really liked was the Oxygen OS. It always has constant security updates and if the rumours are true it will receive Android Pie before the end of the year. So I really like that there's that security of receiving constant updates and a vibrant Oneplus community where I've resolved a lot of my questions.In terms of appearance, I really like it. It has a large screen without having a horrible notch. I choose the Sandstone White color and I couldn't be happier. The texture feels really nice to the touch and the contrast with the colors of the buttons is really nice. I'm tempted to go without a case but it seems like it might get scuffed or it would absorb dirt. For now, I'm using the transparent case it comes with because it still shows the amazing color but it protects the corners in case I scuff it against anything. In the future, I will either be brave to go caseless or find one I like. But there no much hope of that because all the cases I've found seem designed with men in mind.The sound quality is fine for me, it's not outstanding but I don't expect that from a phone. But where it totally wins is that it still has a headphone jack! I only imagine the pain in the ass it would be to buy bluetooth headphones or to carry a dongle! never!!The camera is also really good, it doesn't have all the fancy functions that other phones have, but I'm no expert photographer so I don't need much.The only things I haven't liked is that it seems to have connectivity issues, so my wifi suddenly disconnects several times throughout the day. It also doesn't allow me to turn off my alarm in the morning by swiping my screen as indicated, instead, I'm forced to press the power button. That was a bit annoying to have to figure out at the crack of dawn! Also, I don't like that Android Oreo doesn't let me turn my phone upside down, instead I need an extra app for that. What annoys me is that most of these issues have been extensively reported by the Oneplus community, even for previous versions and they haven't been corrected yet! So that discourages me a little but I hope they will be corrected in the future. Most of them are little issues, but my work is finding bugs in software so once I see them I can't help but notice them. But apart from that I'm really satisfied and couldn't wish for anything better!!!\", 'Great phone at first use. Fast, easy to use, no bloatware, very happy with the device. Comes with a slim TPU cover which is a nice touch', 'First impression is great. For the last 7 years i use nexus and pixel (since march update stop function completely).One plus great performance, excellent quality of screen, hope use one plus for nexts generations!', \"Just got mine today, works perfect. honestly the best phone I've ever owned. Glad I finally made the purchase and stopped staring at it in my cart lol.\", 'Have the oneplus 3 great phone very fast so I bought the oneplus 5t for my brother.', 'Greeeaaaattt phone. Enjoying it after receiving yesterday. The shipping was faster than stated and packaging came as described. Love my OPT5t. Switched out from Samsung.', 'excellent phone, shipping was very fast with this seller also !', \"Excellent condition with cellophane instructions in the box and original stickers.New condition. This phone has been discontinued for the notched op6 and I hate notches. If you also hate notches just like me, and can live with a 30 day guarantee rather than a year let NGP be your hard to find phone importer. You will not regret it. I have no envy over the op6 and in my opinion this phone design is better in every way. Don't sweat it if you get a Brittish edition because a euro to us adapter converter is only a couple of dollars on Amazon. The only op edition phone really different is the Chinese edition because it has Hydrogen with out play store. You can easily switch the language and input on all others to us English. I've had this phone since April and it's a powerhouse speed wise and the camera is a beast. It has some lowlight performance. For the price you can not beat it even with the extra 80 bucks tacked on to the original price. I would not go back on this deal for anything in the world. Op6 is over hyped. This is the phone to get.\", 'Totally worth the money, it was my first OnePlus device and I was shocked! Battery was still holding 40% at the end if the day!', \"Absolutely love it, the most powerful phone at this price point, a mix of flagship killer and full fledged flagship. Great finger scanner and facial recognition, pretty much stock Android, phone never slows down with multiple apps open thanks to the 8gb of RAM, and surprisingly it has not heated up on me  even when I'm using the most demanding apps. Best feature is the quick dash charging and the long battery life. Only downside could be the camera, I'm not a huge selfie taker, so for me it's definitely not a deal breaker, but I know others are, so if you want the best pics a mobile phone can offer, maybe stick to a Pixel 2 or and iPhone X, otherwise if power and reliability are your thing then get the 5T.\", \"Great phone. Glad I purchased this. Cameras amazing and the speed and response is amazing. Battery life is great. Simple and easy if that's what you're looking for. $600 can't beat that price for high end smartphones out there that are going for $800+.\", 'Best flagship phone for this low cost ,amazing sped, one of the best camera. Definitely recommend to anyone.', 'Fantastic smartphone. Super fast, no useless apps, thin and light. Camera is good.

Really nothing to complain, fast and reliable', \"This phone totally kicks butt!  Super fast, TONS of memory, and great camera.Takes a little getting used to moving from an iPhone to Android, and I do miss some of the built in functionalty of the iPhone (there is no comparable Android app to Apple Podcasts).  But, for half the price of the newest iPhone, that's an easy one to adapt to.  One drawback is, since it is not common in the US, there aren't as many quality accessories for it.  The screen protector I bought does not really adhere well to the edges, so it looks cheap when the screen is not on.  That's about it.\", 'Great device, upgraded from the OnePlus 2.

Just received it today.Only problem is that the storage is 111gb instead of the 128gb I was promised. I need answers.', 'Excellent, must buy phone. It was ready to go as soon as i turn it on.', 'Very fast delivery!!! I recommend', \"Pretty much 4 years after its first phone, I am finally a OnePlus phone owner!And oh boy this phone is keeping his promises…So I went with the top of the line version,128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. 8GB!!! This is just like my laptop...Since I love taking pics and videos, storage is important for me.So, this is my review of the OnePlus 5t after almost 2 months as a daily driver.Let’s get straight to the main point, I don’t recall last time I felt my phone so reliable. And this is the probably one of the 3 best word to describe this phone, reliable.The simplest way I can explain this, is the fact I never had any lag or bug with the phone or neither the battery, whatever the situation I was dealing with. And this is what you expect from a smartphone, reliability. You want to know that your phone will not bug when you get an important call, or when you have to write a quick email while you’re sitting for a couple of minutes in your Uber ride. Or even most important, you have a very long conference day including travels and you want be sure your phone will survive the day without the stress to find a plug to charge it.Other than that this phone met all my expectations. Amazing speed, top notch software and massive battery.Before my OnePlus 5t, I actually thought I couldn’t be able to see a speed difference with my last phone, which was powerful enough. I was wrong. Thanks to its solid specifications and a flawless software, this phone is by far the fastest I ever had.Speaking about the battery, it is simply the best. For the first time, I am able to keep my phone for almost 2 days with no need to charge. I am really impressed. And if, for some reason I need to juice up a bit, the Dash charger is the most impressive I ever saw. This is ridiculously fast.I could add a fifth star if the camera was better. Don't get me wrong, the camera is good, just not among the best.To summarize in 3 words to describe this phone : Reliable, snappy, powerful.And all this come in this beautiful lava red color!\", \"I have had alot of phones in my time this is the best one by far I have alot of games and 4k videos and things that take up alot of storage and the storage is not even close to being full it has a amazing camera I use every day the phone  it is very fast and has good virus protection except it's not perfect if you decide to by this phone like I did by a case with it in the box it does include a case but that case is not protective what so ever and it is very slippery and when you hold It there's always that anxiety about dropping it also if you use metro PC's there may be some slight issues this phone is gsm unlocked not fully so when you go to a metro PC's store if you use metro PC's make sure to get a gsm Sim card and beyond those two things this is an amazing phone with lots of potential I would recommend it to anyone\", \"PP - Perfect Product -It's worth every Dollar . Super Fast - Brilliant Battery Charge - Amazing Camera - Amazing Performance , more than 90 applications installed in less than one hour via Google . Only cons could be no headphones included in the package . Best Flagship relationship money/quality.Excellent work and congratulations for the OnePlus Team .\", \"This is a pretty good phone.  I was very unhappy to have to switch from my old Nexus 6 but it started to die.  This is a decent replacement.I've had it about a month so here are my thoughts:Pros:Excellent battery life, lasts >1 day on a single chargeGood color balance & saturation in screenVery responsive & fastLots of storageClean UIFace unlock is very handy* (when it works)Dash charging is so fast!!!*Cons:Face unlock feature is buggy and doesn't work all the time.  I've gotten used to using it so when it doesn't work it's frustrating.Only one speaker and it's not front facing with tinny sound qualityI had to purchase all new cables since this phone is USB C.  The dash charger will only charge fast with the dadh brand cables also (which are only 3 feet long).Camera leaves A LOT to be desired. The native software is terrible, especially for low light photos, they look grainy and overly doctored.  This really is the main disappointment considering the price.\", \"I'm writing this review from my phone, this is the fastest phone I've ever had and the best one at performance, I couldn't ask for anything better. Great performance, great screen, works properly ans it's amazing in every sense.\", \"It's perfect! I remember saving up for months to get this specific phone and it's just as you expect. Everything runs smoothly, battery lasts pretty good and it charges super fast. The only things I don't like is the low light camera quality which isn't very good. (Hence the 4 stars). But you cant beat it for the price. It runs games super smooth, I have yet to run out of storage, and it's semi-compatible with Verizon. It does work you just lose service a lot and don't get 4G LTE.Edit: Forgot to mention how fast the facial recognition was. I didn't believe it was real until I kept putting it infront of people's faces then switching it to mine wnd it unlocking instantly. It even unlocks when you're a few feet away from it or the camera isn't directly on you.\", \"This phone has to be the best phone I've ever bought in my life 8 gigabytes of RAM 128 storage and the performance is right there\", 'I love love this space... This phone is responsive, the pictures are awesome, the music quality is pretty good, the sound is sweet. I love theone plus life!!!', \"Fastest, best performance on a phone I've ever had. With 8GB of ram, you don't have to constantly clean up apps that are open just to use your apps without lag.\", 'Extremely satisfied with this phone my first flagship phone in a very very long time I would recommend this phone to anyone that is interested in having an amazing product at a very good price I will definitely continue buying Plus One ne products', 'Price is horrible, compared to the website.

Battery is great. Charging is nuts! Blazing.', 'Excellent, I like it  :=)', 'My husband loves it , it works and it comes with a case as well', \"The phone is conveniently fast due to its octa-core processor. The phone's battery can last a person a day and a half with moderate usage. Battery is not removable, but battery's capacity is more than sufficient. The phone is GSM compatible so it will work on the T-mobile and AT&T networks. The call volume is perfect and with VoLte a person will not worry about call interference while on the phone. The one plus 5t also features wifi calling. The phone does not come with Oreo out of the box, but it can be immediately upgraded to Oreo. The phone comes with a headphone jack, which is conveniently placed at the bottom right of the bezel. There's one speaker on the bottom left side, which provides adequate sound. The phone comes with face recognition and a fingerprint scanner, which is a plus for people who don't want to enter a PIN or draw a pattern to unlock the phone. Overall, this a good product and is in my opinion one of the best phones on the market.\", 'Great phone !!!', \"I've owned both a Oneplus 3 and a 5T, and neither survived more than a couple drops before becoming inoperable.

I would honestly look elsewhere if you're looking for a device with any kind of durability in mind.\", 'I just received this phone by mail this morning, it keeps either turning itself on and off or freezing up entirely.

I'll have to pay for it. And there was pictures already in the phone, so I know it was used. Overall, no warranty at the price 550ish might have been a gamble on a used phone, but so far it's running strong.\", \"I have really wanted to like this phone.  The picture quality is great, and it performs well and is very responsive.  It has some well designed features, such as its notification system, and I like how there is very little bloat-ware installed and it is easy to use.  Unfortunately, I've had intermittent BlueTooth connectivity issues since I bought this phone directly from the manufacturer in 2017.  The phone will hiccup and stop broadcasting sound, or completely disconnect during phone calls and other audio operations with multiple devices (car and a few pairs of headphones).  There are times it is nearly perfect and will run for hours without incident, and other times where I lose sound quality multiple times a minute, or the headset completely disconnects.Since the problem started, I've had countless back and forth conversations with the manufacturer to try to resolve the issue.  In nearly every case, they've asked for a lengthy process to catalog cases in which the disconnects occur, and then upload files to them to troubleshoot.  Usually after that there is a period of inactivity where not much information is given but I am given a hearty thanks for my contribution.  After multiple uploaded files, back and forth conversations, and system updates, the BlueTooth connection is even worse (it went from merely annoying to nearly unusable after the last update of their Oxygen OS 5.1.7.)  To be fair, I told them after the third set of files I gave them (over multiple months in contact with them) that I was no longer interested in running the debugger and delivering more failure data.Unfortunately, despite the many positive features of the phone, it falls well short for many of my use cases (a podcast player, a music player at work, ability to make phone calls using my headset, etc.).  As a result, I have been using an old phone to handle nearly all of my media uses.  I don't think I will buy from this company again.\", \"'ve had one plus phones for years.

This results in your issues never being resolved and then getting stuck with a phone that doesn\\'t completely function. Buy from that company again because you want to support their \\'cause\\' Then get treated like a liar again. So you just pay money to return the new phone that has the same issues.I bought a oneplus 5 because I thought I may have better luck with it than I did with the oneplus 3 that I bought a year or so ago. I currently still have that oneplus 3 and am typing this review on it. It has mild battery issues, and no matter the APN settings I have tried- I cannot get over 4.4Mbps on ATTs LTE network. These aren\\'t huge issues as I generally dont need the higher speeds and carrying a charge isn\\'t a huge burden. But id prefer to not have these issues. I bought the oneplus 5 hoping that these issues would no longer be present. I was wrong. I bought from Oneplus again because I liked what I thought oneplus stood for. The OP5 will also never hit over 4.4 Mbps even standing in an ATT building- right next to my girlfriends iphone thats getting 15-25Mbps. The OP5 also gets about the same battery life to my OP3, try to browse the internet for 40 minutes in the morning with the screen set to almost unreadably dim and you\\'ll go from 100 to 70%. Then see where you are right after lunch. It gets tight sometimes on your way home.Though none of this is really my issue or why I choose to give this phone two stars. I had contacted oneplus numerous times to resolve these issues with my oneplus 3. They will not let you speak to a technician.

My prior model was the A3000, so maybe the comparison comes a little bit outdated. I'm very pleased with the boost the camera got (now dual), pictures look sharpier and colourful (I guess the Optic AMOLED display also has something to do with that). The battery life as managed by the OS, lasts longer. Also the body seems sturdier and I couldn't be happier with the speed you get both from face recognition and/or fingerprint sensor (now in the back). Getting accustomed to the notch comes rather easier than I thought, even so having both notch sides for notifications is very welcomed. Oxygen OS is swift and clean as ever, with the usual personalization being friendly and straightforward.

I paid 600 for my S4 a year or two ago through my carrier. The aspect that I enjoy the most is not having the tons of Samsung apps that do not add anything to my day to day life. This phone came stock with Google Chrome and not much else besides the necessities such as a camera and other basics. Not having SD card support brings the phone down one star, but for most people (i.e. those that don't download a bunch of movies to their phones) the 64 GB of internal storage should be plenty of storage space. One other thing that bothers me is that the battery life isn't the best, but when you consider the performance that you are getting it is understandable.

Yep its older than the Oneplus 3 and Oneplus 3T but I wanted a cheaper phone that is also good. Besides I like that the headphone jack is on the top of the phone instead of the bottom.

Overall the phone is great, and well worth it in 2017. It breezes through demanding tasks and is fluid during basic ones. The display although not OLED is plenty sharp at 401ppi and 1080p resolution. At 5.5 inches its the same screen size as a iPhone 7+ with the phone having a smaller footprint. The fingerprint sensor is plenty fast and I hardly have any trouble with it. Overall great value for your money, and if you are willing to spend a little extra try getting the Oneplus 3 or 3T on their website though as it is more expensive to buy them on amazon.

Otherwise, I will be using this as my primary phone when my lease payments on the SG note 5 is finished in 7 months.', 'I have owned this phone for about 3 weeks and I have to admit, I am very surprised at how well it looks/performs. Upgrading from my Samsung S4 after 2.5 years, I was anxious to see what this so called \"flagship killer\" had in store. I did consider buying a new Samsung Galaxy phone but I simply was not ready to shell out several hundred dollars for a new device.I knew this phone was going to surprise me in many ways as soon as it arrived the mail. The packaging of the device is beautiful and it comes with a charger cable (USB-C), which is claimed to become the future standard for newer smartphones (the new Samsung S8 is supposedly going to use this input as well). The phone came pre-charged, which allowed for easy set-up after booting the device up. The sleek design and feel of the smartphone will surprise many, especially since this device is below $300.00 dollars now after being released in mid-2015. The Oxygen-OS that OnePlus has designed for their smartphones echoes the design of a typical stock Android OS. The apps look modern and unique and they provide easy access to about everything you need to use a smartphone for (e-mail, camera, social media, etc.)Performance on this device destroys that of my older Samsung S4. I have not experienced any type of crashing/freezing on this device in the past few weeks that I have been using it. I can have multiple apps running in the background and I still don\\'t receive any type of hiccup from the device itself. The display on the OnePlus 2 is a high quality 1080p screen, which produces very vibrant and popping colors. The fingerprint sensor takes some time getting used to but once you get the hang of it, it works flawlessly.For those of you who are skeptical of buying this phone, I hope that this review will change your mind. This phone in my opinion, is just as good as any new iPhone/Galaxy phones that were released recently. The camera and all the features that come along with it only make it an even more impressive so called \"budget\" smartphone. I would encourage you to buy it and see for yourself', \"Excellent phone.

Overall - I love the phone!\", \"I loved this phone until the home button/fingerprint button stopped working; they're known for doing this. OnePlus Customer Service is awful! Took three weeks of going back and forth before they decided that they would repair my phone. I had the phone for less than 90 days.

My phone is currently being shipped back to me from OnePlus stating that because the Warranty Sticker has been removed, the phone is no longer covered by the warranty. OnePlus has been the only ones to work on my phone. Because of their negligence (of not replacing the Warranty Sticker from the first time being repaired), they refuse to repair it, so I'm stuck with a broken phone.\", '* First phone arrived defective.  The following is for the replacement.* Phone stopped accepting updates after a month or so.

I would rather buy an expensive phone directly from google.', \"This is the third OnePlus phone I've bought. This phone is a great phone but each one I've had came with certain little things that would go wrong. It is impossible to get in touch with the OnePlus people so I don't even try anymore. My current issue is that the screen seems to swipe itself out of the blue. As soon as I can afford it I'm going to ditch this phone and get a Samsung. I cannot recommend this phone and gave it two stars just because for the most part it's a decent phone. With good customer service I would be a lifetime customer.\", \"Don't get me wrong the phone is awesome, for the price give, truly spec are pretty good, only issue I'm having is fingerprint and both back and menu buttons stopped working out of nowhere...

To make a long story short, I got one weekly response and shortly after I was ignored for an entire month.  Two months later I was told I was out of luck and if I wanted any help they need to get on my system and have my phone plugged into my PC, however how am I supposed to do that when that function doesn\\'t even work?TL;DR: If you need a phone for a month or two go with this.

I would never have imagined that its late 2015 replacement would make my old Nexus 5 look like a speed demon.Laggy response in too many circumstances to name. Seems to stop responding to touch input for several seconds, then suddenly catches up and tries to process all your buffered inputs. Freezes and/or spontaneously reboots at least once every 72 hours. Massive color distortion in photos taken using any kind of digital zoom (sample attached).I hunted for tips to solve known bugs/issues. Found some that looked promising, but none were effective. Have owned the phone for just over a month, and my patience is pretty much gone. Did I just get a lemon? Maybe.

I use my phone for work and family. This is completely unacceptable, but I did it (thank goodness I kept my old phone).

I needed to return it!\", 'does not support the Russian language', 'As usual, the star rating has let me down, but if I had my choice, I\\'d give this phone 2.5 stars.Overall:OnePlus sells this phone as the \\'flagship killer\\', with it\\'s impressive display, camera, and low price point, it seems to hit the nail on the head. It seems as if OnePlus has truly tried to make a great phone, as technically there\\'s no downside to this devise as opposed to many other flagships. Starting the phone up you immediately notice the display. It\\'s sharp and crisp and appears bigger and better than most screens I\\'ve experienced. Unlike most modern phones, there\\'s a pretty large gap between the top and bottom of the screen and the phone itself; however the symmetry of the gap makes it look sleek, not awkward. The buttons on the side of the screen feel good in your hand, as does the coarse matte-black back. The UI which comes preinstalled is one I was semi-familiar with, and the preset settings don\\'t seem invasive. OnePlus touts the camera to be best-on-market, and I see no reason to disagree. The lens seems to zoom and focus precisely and quickly. Compared to other phones I\\'ve had (G3,MotoX,Nexus5), this camera takes the cake.Once I started to use the device more, I became less and less impressed. Within the first twenty minutes of being activated, the phone froze. Sure, I was installing an app while running another, but with the \"impressive qualcomm processor\" I figured this would be little issue. This was a true freeze, as the phone got increasingly hot and didn\\'t respond for 60-seconds, I was forced to restart. I concluded that maybe it was doing things in the background as well, having been just set up, and that I\\'ll take it easy for a while and return to the task.After setting up the phone to how I wanted it, I started heavily using the apps I always have. Many of them barely function at all, and prove a difficult task for the phone. Opening Snapchat freezes the phone for 20 seconds, some games immediately crash, and many things are slow or laggy. About once a day I have to force restart the phone because it froze switching apps or opening something. Additionally, because this is a \\'3rd party\\' phone, many apps are not optimized for it. the phone won\\'t even load the GOOGLE WIDGET sometimes!!! The phone gets quite hot with just limited use. While the battery isn\\'t BAD, it\\'s not amazing either, and will not last more than a day, which is all that really matters.Overall, I have to give this phone a bad review. I\\'d been using a LG G3 for about two years and besides the screen, there\\'s nothing the OnePlus does better. While the hardware seems to be stunning, it doesn\\'t run smoothly and isn\\'t taken advantage of in a way the user can admire. The screen freezing and slow performance compared to friends phones are insanely disappointing. I was so ready to show this phone off to all my friends and be a member of the $350 club, but showing it off, they all remarked on the same things I did (slowness, freezing, heat, awkward interfaces with the UI) within five minutes. We\\'ll have to see what OnePlus can bring to the table next, but I was in no way impressed with this version.Pros:$350 price point puts it much cheaper than some of it\\'s competitorsScreen is beautiful, lights up nicelyLooks great and feels amazing in the handCamera is one of the best on the mobile marketNeutral:Large space between the screen and phone borderBattery life on-par with competitorsGeneral call/antennae quality quite goodCons:Freezes under heavy workload, even as new deviceMany apps/widgets don\\'t seem to work within the UIMay act particularly buggy/slow within many appsPhone becomes quite hot with prolonged use', \"I am really disappointed with this phone. I have recently decided to switch from Apple to Android and I feel like I've made a big mistake. I've had an iphone 5 for the last couple of years and an Iphone 4 beforehand. Overall, I find that my old iphone 4 performs much better than this phone. From the constant crashes to the lagging, for a phone this new the performance appears to be amateur at best and comparable to  budget smartphones sold for under $100.00. The battery life is actually worse than my 2 year old iPhone as well. Don't waste your money, folks.\", 'I bought this a month ago, then they released the much better \\'3\\' for $40 more than I paid. \"Fuuuuu\"*edit* the camera lens broke. Just buy a oneplus 3.

I followed the advice of another customer and filed a PayPal claim when the efforts to resolve the problem were not leading to any reasonable solution. PayPal helped to receive full refund for the purchase because the item was within 180 days from the date of the shipment. Lesson learned - no more flagship killers, just the flagships.___________________________________________________________________________________________________________It seemed to be a great phone when I was looking at the website and reading through the specifications. I went ahead and ordered the phone and it arrived on May 5, 2016. It had a short battery life, but that was not concern for me because I can recharge if needed at work, part of me was somewhat concerned with 3300 battery not holding up, especially being flagship killer.The home/fingerprint button quit working on June 19, 2016. After performing factory reset, which did not help, I called the technical support.  They suggested that it is a hardware problem and phone needs to be sent back. Since “it is Sunday” someone will contact you with arranging that tomorrow. I received an email next day requesting the proof of purchase, which I immediately sent. Then another email from “escalation team” asking me if I want to create an RMA. I confirmed that.I have not heard from them the next day so I called. First tech support guy did not find an RMA for the phone and was going to create one. He also described the process that the phone will be fixed within 7-10 days and shipped back. I asked for a new phone because it is only 45 days old or at least a replacement. After that request the tech guy hang up on me. I called back and the second technician refused to send a replacement or a loaner. I asked to speak with a supervisor and supervisor suggested to do a remote session to reinstall the operating system. Again, the requests for a loaner or a replacements were rejected – “we only can do it if you had it for 15 days.” The whole process should take “approximately 1 hour.” They did not have an availability for today, so there was a time slot booked for tomorrow.Regardless the outcome tomorrow, the whole phone/customer service experience seems to be inadequate for a “flagship killer.” On the other hand, few hundred $$ is a cheap price for a life lesson – go with a flagship next time.', \"I bought this phone shortly after seeing it, having gotten a good recommendation from a friend. The phone feels nice and has a very good layout. It seems to have enough power to get me through the day. However the battery is just okay. With only one background app running this phone lasted about 5 hours. It also required the fast charging cube in order to charge at a reasonable rate. If plugged into any other USB port it will only prolong the battery however it will still die. My only real problem though is that the company lists it as being compatible with any cell service carrier whether in the US or overseas. However, when I went to activate it through Verizon, which is one of the largest providers in America, I figured out that the phone is not compatible with the 700 mhz bandwidth that Verizon uses. The fact that this company lied about their phones compatibilities causes me to question what else they might have lied about. Maybe the phone isn't all that the company says it is.Pros-Great design(Seemingly)Very PowerfulGood OSCons-DOES NOT SUPPORT VERIZON\", 'I bought my phone in February 2016 directly from One Plus, and I was fairly happy with it till one fine morning in August 2016, it started buzzing repeatedly as if I was touching the fingerprint sensor. I couldn’t get it to stop till I did a hard restart. After that, it said “Fingerprint hardware not available” and apparently the sensor had died. Sifting through the reviews revealed that it’s not an uncommon issue.I contacted customer service and they said I can send the device back for repair. I made a couple of long trips to Europe in the next three months, so I couldn’t get it into repair till January. In the meantime, I managed to drop my phone and crack the screen, which itself was a little upsetting since I would have hoped it to be a little more durable to a fall from waist height. My previous phones (especially Moto G) had taken tumbles on concrete with nothing but a scratch.I sent my device for repair, and I was told that I will have to pay $104 to repair the screen and the sensor. I told them, I was OK with the cracked screen and all I was hoping was for them to repair the fingerprint sensor. We had several exchanges but no matter how much I tried to appeal to logic, they had the well rehearsed line, “It’s company policy to repair everything.” I didn’t want to spend a hundred dollar on a year old device so I gave up and asked for my phone back. Now, I am just making do with it using the onscreen navigation since the home button (fingerprint sensor) is totally non-functional. The battery life has deteriorated to the point that it goes from 100% to 30% in the couple hours I am at the gym listening to music and recording my workouts on google sheets. Waiting for the new wave of phones this year before I sadly get rid of it.I wanted to love this device as it came with such big promises but it just doesn’t cut it. A good, customer focused company would have helped me and replaced the faulty part but instead they made me jump the hoops with no results. All in all, I think my experiment to support an off-brand device failed, and I for one, am never going for a One Plus phone again.', \"It doestn't have durable lines\", \"Do yourself a favor and DO NOT purchase this phone. I bought it because it seemed decent for the price, but the amount of headaches its given me more than made up for what I saved.The fingerprint doesn't work, the home button lags and often stops working completely.The camera is decent at best and it barely holds charge for a full work shift.Most recently, the volume button broke and now my phone is perpetually lowering the volume. This comes with the added problem where if I turn my phone off and try to turn it back on, it reboots on fast mode and won't do anything else. And now, even the power button stops working all of a sudden and starts working again at its whim. It's impossible to even try to figure out a solution to these problems since the battery and everything else is inaccessible.I've been suffering for eight months with this enormous turd of a phone and am constantly worried about it giving out on me any second. I kept trying to give it a chance because of the good reviews I've read about OnePlus, but it has steadily disappointed.If you really want to try a OnePlus phone, try going up or down (though I hear of the same button issues with the OnePlus One), but after this wretched experience I won;t be returning to this brand again.\", 'I bought this phone 22 Feb 2016, November 2016 the phone crashes and would not reboot.

I was thinking of returning it because I'm not getting the oneplus experience I loved from oneplus 1, 2 and 3, but I changed my mind because after 2 weeks I got used to most of the little things I didn't like about it or found a workaround for them.It always comes down to little things, especially when you are considering oneplus:Firstly, the build is different; the screen is much bigger so I can't work with it with one hand anymore like I did with the 3. It feels more bulky, heavier and thicker. Sometimes my hand aches from working with it for a long time with one hand, didn't happen with 3.Secondly software; The recent apps now shows the apps in full size side by side, doesn't show the apps stacked on each other, so you have to swipe way more to reach to the app you want, very poor design choice, I think this is on Google though.You can not anymore assign a navigation button for opening the last used app when you do long touch. So on the 6 you can only achieve this by double tapping the recent apps button which is far from my thumb. Or by changing the navigation buttons order to have one home and one back buttn, then you can swipe the home button to switch between your recent apps.The fingerprint is on the back compared to the 3 and I know almost all the phones are now using this design, but my finger doesn't hit the right spot in the first try almost every time, I have to carefully pay attention to where I put my finger, slows me down a lot. (UPDATE: this is no problem anymore! got used to it)The vibration haptic feedback has changed completely! I loved the minimal feedback from my 3 for each tap and while typing. Now I feel a very heavy and deep vibration for every tap. I can't decide if I should turn it off or live through the bad feeling every time. (UPDATE: got used to this as well!)Camera; The camera is obviously a better quality, but compared to the oneplus 3 it launches veeery much slower, it's ridiculous. When you double tap the power button the camera launches 1 to 2 seconds after.The display is awesome, no problem with the notch.I wish they make a slightly smaller version with fingerprint on the front.\", 'When this phone drops below $500,buy it. I know I will!', 'This reseller is great! I received the item on time and everything works great!', 'Phone is great and fast.', 'Package was perfect, the phone is awesome, all good', 'I have been an avid enthusiast of smartphones since high school and this past summer I was looking to purchase a new smartphone and ended buying the OnePlus 6. I can easily say that there is nothing I regret about this purchase and the phone has met every need that I was looking for.  The smartphone market has been dominated over the years by Apple’s iPhone line and Samsung’s Galaxy line while every other manufacturer has struggled to break into the market. OnePlus’s approach to this was to make a high-quality phone that is priced much lower than Apple and Samsung products, with their ideal users being people who want a unique product that stands out when people see it.  From a technical standpoint, the OnePlus is as up-to-date and as powerful as any other smartphone on the market, including the Samsung Galaxy S9 and the iPhone X, from its immersive display to its responsive software, the $600 OnePlus 6 performs like a $1000 product. My priorities in a smartphone include great battery life, quick performance and a sleek physical design, and the OnePlus 6 checks all of these features.--Battery Life: Even on days when I’m streaming lots of music, videos, taking photos or just general heavy use, I have almost always had battery left at the end of the day. Even if I was running super low, OnePlus includes a fast charging cable which mitigates any concern about battery life.--Performance: With the latest technology inside the phone and Google’s optimized operating system, I have never experienced my phone slowing down or being overloaded with any task.--Physical Design: The full screen display, glass finish on the back and overall smooth contours make the OnePlus 6 feel and look good in the hand.The only two areas where I might ask for an improvement would be the external speaker and camera quality.--Speaker: While the loud speaker on the phone is not very loud, it is not something that affects me because I usually use headphones and there is not issue with sound production through my earbuds.--Camera: There is no real issue with the cameras on the OnePlus 6, but it is widely accepted that the cameras on the iPhone X and Samsung Galaxy S9 are the best smartphone cameras on the market. However, I am not a professional photographer so the small details and features that it lacks don’t bother me at all, as the output from the OnePlus 6 cameras are still good, if not great.Overall, the OnePlus offers premium features for a mid range price tag, and I have not experienced any functional issue while using it. Although there are some areas of potential improvement, those requests are overshadowed by the performance and value making this a five-star purchase for me.', \"Every aspect of this phone is great. There is no negative at least from my perspective. I get 2 full days on a charge. And when i charge it charges lightening fast. Camera is great, speed is the absolute best (even better than the Galaxy S9+ i replaced with this phone) screen is sharp and bright,  reception (on AT&T LTE) is great and there is zero bloat. Best of all that I've noticed after months of using it, it just never slows down! Even with the 6t coming out tomorrow, it just never slows down. With iphones and galaxies they always slow them down when the new ones come out. Not OnePlus.  And it was 500 dollars when comparable phones are 800-1,000 dollars. I would highly recommend this phone to any one!\", 'This phone is awesome I it have it', 'I put in my SIM card from a verizon iPhone and it works.Otherwise the phone is just as described by others and online reviews - fast, easy to use, excellent camera though a bit slow.', 'With the smartphone market now saturated with over-priced or under-valued phones, the Oneplus 6 is just the answer to all demands I have with a smartphone. I consider myself quite savvy with electronics, and I must say, the OnePlus 6 is quite a sight to behold! The snapdragon 845 is extremely powerful (albeit it does get slightly hot when performing demanding tasks, to be expected from such a powerful chip) and should deliver quality performance for years to come. I do not typically purchase a new phone unless its free with an upgrade, but every passing day signifies the completion of a new milestone in technology, thus resulting in the need for better hardware. I really REALLY love that they kept the headphone jack and will not be buying the oneplus 6t or any model hereafter that does not include one. The battery I will admit, is lacking after a day of power usage, however with dash charging I have not found carrying my charger and charging once or twice a day to be inconvenient at all. Oxygen OS is a blessing from the Android Gods, and I feel it necessary to include that one of the strongest aspects of this device is the skin OnePlus has integrated over stock Android. This is not quite the nexus line in terms of open android (custom roms are extremely hit or miss, which I find to be annoying, but I can live with it for now) however time may prove it to be even better. I say I find the lack of custom ROMs and slow development to be annoying, but this may just be old habits stemming from associating proprietary skins with useless and wasteful bloatware/features that have no practicality whatsoever, something that Oxygen OS absolutely lacks. Every feature they include is useful, and the 2 applications I could consider \"bloatware\" are easily removed even without a Terminal Emulator. Needless to say I intend to run this thing for 2, maybe 3 years, and based on my initial impressions, I have no doubt that it will stand strong against the test of time. PhenomenalNow for cons, this phone does not have many, but the most stand-out issue is the lack of proprietary heat dissipation. There is no heat pipe or thermal solution whatsoever in this device. This is slightly mitigated by the all-glass design (which in itself is NOT a con, check with speedtest) which allows the heat to be quickly absorbed and dissipated throughout the body. however this does irk me as heat will be the death of this phone. All things considered, given OnePlus\\' reputation for outstanding engineering and rigorous manufacturing/approval process, I have faith that the engineers have already investigated this and trust that their decision to not include such things is indeed for reasons other than cost cutting. It is something to note, however, and I take off one star entirely for this reason and this reason alone. Other than that, this device is almost flawless.Note: Some people may consider the 2280x1080 display as being a con, however 1440p on a screen this small only enhances visuals so well and demands much more of the core components inside causing even more heat and worse battery life.

Eight months into use (after repairing the sim tray) I accidentally let the phone slip from my lap onto the tarmac as I was getting out of taxi. The result is on the attached picture. The display permanently failed, could not touch/control the phone. Had to take it to a repair shop for a screen replacement ($200). Two months after the screen was replaced (with an original part), I accidentally pushed the phone off my bed onto the laminated flooring. The screen gave a crack again (in the lower part but the display is still working). Upshot: I would only recommend this phone if you NEVER EVER drop you phone. Same goes for 5T which I had hoped would be an improvement but still has the same shitty screen (only upgrade being the camera and two extra gigs of ram). I am buying an S8 Plus this week. Enough is enough.I needed a new phone and after some research opted for OnePlus 3T, given top specs and competitive price. I am very content with its design, slim look and fast hardware which I in fact preferred to Samsung Galaxy S7 at the time of purchase (price was not an issue). However, one month into use I discovered a deplorable design flaw of this phone which made me take off 2 stars of its rating straight off.The first time I dropped it, it got scratches and indents (i.e. the back cover and display are not nearly as sturdy as they were on my previous Galaxy S3 which survived all sorts of punishments until the plastic back cover gave a tiny crack after 4 years of use) but worst of all the SIM-card extraction mechanism permanently failed. I then went to two phone repair shops and they refused to service this phone due to a high risk of the display cracking when opening the phone/removing the back cover. The third repair shop I went to said they could try to open the phone and replace the SIM tray extraction mechanism at my own risk (50/50) which meant if they failed to successfully remove the back cover, I would be in for a 33% of its initial purchase price display replacement. I was lucky and they managed to open it up and replace the failed SIM mechanism for a price which is 7% of the phone's purchase price.The bottom line: OnePlus 3 has a very fragile SIM extraction mechanism and the SIM tray sits very close to the display which means that whenever you drop this phone or throw it on your sofa there is a high risk the SIM card will come out of the tray and get stuck against the display screen or, as in my case, the SIM extraction mechanism will fail altogether which means you either live on with the SIM card inside your phone or there is a 50% chance you will have to replace the entire screen and even the phone if you go to repairs. Given that mobile phones make part of everybody's daily life nowadays and are gadgets that are being carried around day to day when walking, jogging, cycling or what not, a phone that breaks when you accidentally drop it is an inherently faulty phone. I hope they will fix this design flaw in OnePlus 4/5.\", \"I bought this phone directly from their website, hoping that I would be contributing to a smaller company of people who are passionate about phones and software, as much as they are about making a quality product, but now I see that that isn't true. Convienently, after my warranty had expired, my rear-facing camera had stopped focusing. This seemed to be a common problem with other users on snapchat, and typically to fix it you would have to open the camera app, focus the camera, then switch to snapchat...EVERY TIME. But, thankfully before that got old, the whole camera just stopped focusing! For the past year or so I've had to use the front facing camera to take pictures, but now I'm just through with OnePlus. Very recently my phone had reset. My pictures and music were still there (thanks for saving SOMETHING) but all of my apps, notes, passwords, etc had been wiped. I have checked to make sure I'm not in guest mode, I have restarted the phone, etc. and nothing has worked. I took a chance on supporting an upcoming, and small company at the time, and will never give another cent to this company again. I know that doesn't matter much, since I am only 1 in a million people that have bought their products, but if you are reading this right now, and thinking about buying a phone from them...DON'T.

For what you pay, I think it is a decent phone. My wife recently retired her nexus 5 due to lack of space and slow processor. We did not want to pay more than $500 ... Our options were another nexus (nexus 6P), Zenfone 3 (not released in the US yet), and oneplus 3 (I havent heard of this brand until recently). We did not want to wait till the release of zenfone 3 (Dear Asus, why are you waiting to release the freaking phone globally? you are losing customers)Body being metal or plastic does not matter to me much. In fact plastic could be better just because it absorbs shock when/if the phone is dropped. Metal will transmit to everywhere on the phone, so the screen is more likely to shatter it is dropped.  It has a fast processor (snapdragon 820?), 6gb ram (probably not necessary), 64 GB space and a mediocre screen.It is fast. Finger print scanner is super fast ... wow! I did not think these things were reliable ... It has enough space.  I do not have to delete photos/videos frequently to open up space. It takes great photos.There is a blue tint on the screen. The white color is not as white as IPS screen. I am told that it is due to amoled screen. So ... it is a compromise. All other colors look more vibrant. Blacks look deeper etc but white has blue-ish tint ...Until you find a good screen protector, do not peel the one that came with this phone. It is a new design/phone, so it will take some time for accessory manufacturers to catch up with it and produce something that fits well.There is some room to improve though :1- Dear OnePlus please get rid of the camera bump by extending the back of the phone a little more. Add more battery to the gained space. I do not think anybody would complain about a few grams of additional weight compare to the extended battery life. This should not be a very costly  improvement.2- Although 64 GB is large enough for today's standards I am sure we will run out of space in a year. Design the phone by thinking a few years ahead ... It would have been great if it had a micro SD slot to expand the memory. This also should not be a costly improvement.3- I wish the screen resolution was a bit better/higher,  but then the price would be close to samsung or Apple ... Then there would be no need to compromise on well established brands.Overall it is a decent phone, and gets the job done, and it is $400.  For the price of a samsung galaxy 7 edge (plus tax blah blah) you can get 2 of these (almost).Update:If you are comfortable with no name phones/brands then there is also ZTE axon 7. It looks a little dull compare to oneplus 3, but when you put an ugly tpu case/cover, any phone will look dull :) Axon 7 is same price as oneplus 3, but it has a better resolution screen, slightly bigger battery, dual front facing speakers, higher resolution camera, and it comes in 64gb / 128gb options.

The snapdragon 845 is extremely powerful (albeit it does get slightly hot when performing demanding tasks, to be expected from such a powerful chip) and should deliver quality performance for years to come. I do not typically purchase a new phone unless its free with an upgrade, but every passing day signifies the completion of a new milestone in technology, thus resulting in the need for better hardware. I really REALLY love that they kept the headphone jack and will not be buying the oneplus 6t or any model hereafter that does not include one. The battery I will admit, is lacking after a day of power usage, however with dash charging I have not found carrying my charger and charging once or twice a day to be inconvenient at all. Oxygen OS is a blessing from the Android Gods, and I feel it necessary to include that one of the strongest aspects of this device is the skin OnePlus has integrated over stock Android. This is not quite the nexus line in terms of open android (custom roms are extremely hit or miss, which I find to be annoying, but I can live with it for now) however time may prove it to be even better. I say I find the lack of custom ROMs and slow development to be annoying, but this may just be old habits stemming from associating proprietary skins with useless and wasteful bloatware/features that have no practicality whatsoever, something that Oxygen OS absolutely lacks. Every feature they include is useful, and the 2 applications I could consider \"bloatware\" are easily removed even without a Terminal Emulator. Needless to say I intend to run this thing for 2, maybe 3 years, and based on my initial impressions, I have no doubt that it will stand strong against the test of time. PhenomenalNow for cons, this phone does not have many, but the most stand-out issue is the lack of proprietary heat dissipation. There is no heat pipe or thermal solution whatsoever in this device. This is slightly mitigated by the all-glass design (which in itself is NOT a con, check with speedtest) which allows the heat to be quickly absorbed and dissipated throughout the body. however this does irk me as heat will be the death of this phone. All things considered, given OnePlus\\' reputation for outstanding engineering and rigorous manufacturing/approval process, I have faith that the engineers have already investigated this and trust that their decision to not include such things is indeed for reasons other than cost cutting. It is something to note, however, and I take off one star entirely for this reason and this reason alone. Other than that, this device is almost flawless.Note: Some people may consider the 2280x1080 display as being a con, however 1440p on a screen this small only enhances visuals so well and demands much more of the core components inside causing even more heat and worse battery life. For people that list this as a con, scroll to about phone, tap \"Build Number\" until you unlock developer options, and then search through developer options until you see \"Force 4x MSAA\" and enable this feature. Though it won\\'t be the physical pixel density associated with 1440p, this should prove satisfactory to those who believe the display to be limited by its resolution. In my opinion however, the 1080p display is more than enough and I believe most people would agree that 1440p might be a little overrated for a 6.3\" displayNote: Some people may also complain about the speaker being low output/mono/tinny at high volumes and while this is a valid complaint please do remember it has a headphone jack and may be the last time we get to see one. I mitigate the subpar speaker based on the fact that I can plug it into any speaker I want.

I say I find the lack of custom ROMs and slow development to be annoying, but this may just be old habits stemming from associating proprietary skins with useless and wasteful bloatware/features that have no practicality whatsoever, something that Oxygen OS absolutely lacks. Every feature they include is useful, and the 2 applications I could consider \"bloatware\" are easily removed even without a Terminal Emulator. Needless to say I intend to run this thing for 2, maybe 3 years, and based on my initial impressions, I have no doubt that it will stand strong against the test of time. PhenomenalNow for cons, this phone does not have many, but the most stand-out issue is the lack of proprietary heat dissipation. There is no heat pipe or thermal solution whatsoever in this device. This is slightly mitigated by the all-glass design (which in itself is NOT a con, check with speedtest) which allows the heat to be quickly absorbed and dissipated throughout the body. however this does irk me as heat will be the death of this phone. All things considered, given OnePlus\\' reputation for outstanding engineering and rigorous manufacturing/approval process, I have faith that the engineers have already investigated this and trust that their decision to not include such things is indeed for reasons other than cost cutting. It is something to note, however, and I take off one star entirely for this reason and this reason alone. Other than that, this device is almost flawless.Note: Some people may consider the 2280x1080 display as being a con, however 1440p on a screen this small only enhances visuals so well and demands much more of the core components inside causing even more heat and worse battery life. For people that list this as a con, scroll to about phone, tap \"Build Number\" until you unlock developer options, and then search through developer options until you see \"Force 4x MSAA\" and enable this feature. Though it won\\'t be the physical pixel density associated with 1440p, this should prove satisfactory to those who believe the display to be limited by its resolution. In my opinion however, the 1080p display is more than enough and I believe most people would agree that 1440p might be a little overrated for a 6.3\" displayNote: Some people may also complain about the speaker being low output/mono/tinny at high volumes and while this is a valid complaint please do remember it has a headphone jack and may be the last time we get to see one.

For people that list this as a con, scroll to about phone, tap \"Build Number\" until you unlock developer options, and then search through developer options until you see \"Force 4x MSAA\" and enable this feature. Though it won\\'t be the physical pixel density associated with 1440p, this should prove satisfactory to those who believe the display to be limited by its resolution. In my opinion however, the 1080p display is more than enough and I believe most people would agree that 1440p might be a little overrated for a 6.3\" displayNote: Some people may also complain about the speaker being low output/mono/tinny at high volumes and while this is a valid complaint please do remember it has a headphone jack and may be the last time we get to see one.

I consider myself quite savvy with electronics, and I must say, the OnePlus 6 is quite a sight to behold! The snapdragon 845 is extremely powerful (albeit it does get slightly hot when performing demanding tasks, to be expected from such a powerful chip) and should deliver quality performance for years to come. I do not typically purchase a new phone unless its free with an upgrade, but every passing day signifies the completion of a new milestone in technology, thus resulting in the need for better hardware. I really REALLY love that they kept the headphone jack and will not be buying the oneplus 6t or any model hereafter that does not include one. The battery I will admit, is lacking after a day of power usage, however with dash charging I have not found carrying my charger and charging once or twice a day to be inconvenient at all. Oxygen OS is a blessing from the Android Gods, and I feel it necessary to include that one of the strongest aspects of this device is the skin OnePlus has integrated over stock Android. This is not quite the nexus line in terms of open android (custom roms are extremely hit or miss, which I find to be annoying, but I can live with it for now) however time may prove it to be even better. I say I find the lack of custom ROMs and slow development to be annoying, but this may just be old habits stemming from associating proprietary skins with useless and wasteful bloatware/features that have no practicality whatsoever, something that Oxygen OS absolutely lacks. Every feature they include is useful, and the 2 applications I could consider \"bloatware\" are easily removed even without a Terminal Emulator. Needless to say I intend to run this thing for 2, maybe 3 years, and based on my initial impressions, I have no doubt that it will stand strong against the test of time. PhenomenalNow for cons, this phone does not have many, but the most stand-out issue is the lack of proprietary heat dissipation. There is no heat pipe or thermal solution whatsoever in this device. This is slightly mitigated by the all-glass design (which in itself is NOT a con, check with speedtest) which allows the heat to be quickly absorbed and dissipated throughout the body. however this does irk me as heat will be the death of this phone. All things considered, given OnePlus\\' reputation for outstanding engineering and rigorous manufacturing/approval process, I have faith that the engineers have already investigated this and trust that their decision to not include such things is indeed for reasons other than cost cutting. It is something to note, however, and I take off one star entirely for this reason and this reason alone. Other than that, this device is almost flawless.Note: Some people may consider the 2280x1080 display as being a con, however 1440p on a screen this small only enhances visuals so well and demands much more of the core components inside causing even more heat and worse battery life.

The snapdragon 845 is extremely powerful (albeit it does get slightly hot when performing demanding tasks, to be expected from such a powerful chip) and should deliver quality performance for years to come. I do not typically purchase a new phone unless its free with an upgrade, but every passing day signifies the completion of a new milestone in technology, thus resulting in the need for better hardware. I really REALLY love that they kept the headphone jack and will not be buying the oneplus 6t or any model hereafter that does not include one. The battery I will admit, is lacking after a day of power usage, however with dash charging I have not found carrying my charger and charging once or twice a day to be inconvenient at all. Oxygen OS is a blessing from the Android Gods, and I feel it necessary to include that one of the strongest aspects of this device is the skin OnePlus has integrated over stock Android. This is not quite the nexus line in terms of open android (custom roms are extremely hit or miss, which I find to be annoying, but I can live with it for now) however time may prove it to be even better. I say I find the lack of custom ROMs and slow development to be annoying, but this may just be old habits stemming from associating proprietary skins with useless and wasteful bloatware/features that have no practicality whatsoever, something that Oxygen OS absolutely lacks. Every feature they include is useful, and the 2 applications I could consider \"bloatware\" are easily removed even without a Terminal Emulator. Needless to say I intend to run this thing for 2, maybe 3 years, and based on my initial impressions, I have no doubt that it will stand strong against the test of time. PhenomenalNow for cons, this phone does not have many, but the most stand-out issue is the lack of proprietary heat dissipation. There is no heat pipe or thermal solution whatsoever in this device. This is slightly mitigated by the all-glass design (which in itself is NOT a con, check with speedtest) which allows the heat to be quickly absorbed and dissipated throughout the body. however this does irk me as heat will be the death of this phone. All things considered, given OnePlus\\' reputation for outstanding engineering and rigorous manufacturing/approval process, I have faith that the engineers have already investigated this and trust that their decision to not include such things is indeed for reasons other than cost cutting. It is something to note, however, and I take off one star entirely for this reason and this reason alone. Other than that, this device is almost flawless.Note: Some people may consider the 2280x1080 display as being a con, however 1440p on a screen this small only enhances visuals so well and demands much more of the core components inside causing even more heat and worse battery life. For people that list this as a con, scroll to about phone, tap \"Build Number\" until you unlock developer options, and then search through developer options until you see \"Force 4x MSAA\" and enable this feature. Though it won\\'t be the physical pixel density associated with 1440p, this should prove satisfactory to those who believe the display to be limited by its resolution. In my opinion however, the 1080p display is more than enough and I believe most people would agree that 1440p might be a little overrated for a 6.3\" displayNote: Some people may also complain about the speaker being low output/mono/tinny at high volumes and while this is a valid complaint please do remember it has a headphone jack and may be the last time we get to see one. I mitigate the subpar speaker based on the fact that I can plug it into any speaker I want. This does not EXCUSE OnePlus for incorporating such a pathetic audio solution, they simply \"dodged a bullet\" with that particular criticism as the industry is generally omitting the headphone port altogether', 'Todo perfecto, producto 100% recomendable. Entrega sin problema y en los tiempos acordados.', 'This is way too much for the mid tier version of the OnePlus 6. I have the 128GB 8GB Ram Mirror Black version. I spent 627.50 for it to include a case and screen protector I purchased for it.', 'Best phones on the market. The 6t (obviously slightly better than the 6)  and 5t are very close.']\n"
